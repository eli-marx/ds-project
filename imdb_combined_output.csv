Aquaman,"I rarely post reviews, but after watching this complete train wreck of a movie I was compelled to warn others about it.

This is by far the worst movie I have ever watched, I don't blame the actors, I think they did what they could with what they had to work with, but the script and the direction was complete garbage.

Until now batman & Robin was the worst movie I had ever seen, but I would rather watch that on repeat a hundred times than ever be reminded of this piece of garbage ever again. I think every one involved in this production should be banned from the movie industry. Why oh why did this ever make it through the cut to stain the cinema industry I don't know.",1
Aquaman,"SORRY JASON MAMOA, WE CANT LET AMBER HEARD RIDE THE COATTAILS OF THE GOOD ACTORS AND BIG BUDGET MOVIE AND LEAPFROG HER CAREER OFF OF IT AND KEEP WORKING!!!!! She's a D scarlet jo anyway!!!!!!! Get her outa here!!!!!!! She should be the star of Blackfish beating the orcas! True to form! And clubbing puppies in the uyling dog festival in China!!!!!! Where she belongs!",1
Aquaman,"Too much water 0/10 ifi could give it that, if i wanted sea documentary of wildlife i would have watched finding nemo",1
Aquaman,Oh seriously Amber Heard is the most untalented actor I have ever seen. Please consider casting again and changing her for someone that can act. Other actors ok! I would have rate this a 6 or 7 but I just can't like her role.,1
Aquaman,Very short review required Poor on all levels!!! A waste of two and a half hours of your life,1
Aquaman,"We took three attempts to finish the movie. Awfull. Awful everything. Chinese director took over, and we could cleraly tell that by his style. I could tell by just looking at it, and then I ve checked the name and here that was. That's how they do their movies, everything is too much. We are from China, so I can tell a bad movie when I see one.",1
Aquaman,"Bad acting, bad special effects, terrible water effect and zero character development. Don't waste your time.",1
Aquaman,"It is not a well structurized movie, especially it being an Aquaman movie",1
Aquaman,"I am a big fan of the superhero franchise. Liked pretty much every film i've seen so far. Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Hulk, Avengers you name it. This Aquaman film however was such a huge dissapointment that i couldn't even finish watching it. Really poor storyline with an even worse set of dialogues. This is the worst i've seen in a long time!",1
Aquaman,"Better than any DCEU film, and some of MCU movies I think. The DC has step up their game - this is another level. Never had I expected this movie will this be good, after the Justice League and Batman V Superman because those movies are trash - and let's forget about those. This is the most ambitious comic-book movie I've ever seen so far. Finally a movie that DC fanboy deserves, this film is just beautiful within the cinematography, visuals, also the action scenes. The action scenes kinda remind me of Romanticism painting, it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I'm not a fan of James Wan movies but he did a marvelous job for Aquaman. The cast are outstanding, badass performances. I don't think any actors can take the role of Aquaman better than Jason Momoa. The atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has high-quality than any DCEU film. Finally we can see the light after those dark days. It has clear motivations for both heroes and villains, pretty solid.

But, DCEU really need to fix their poor lines. The writing isn't the best - some dialogues are still cheesy & awkward. Nothing new for the plot, but it is simply enough - almost the same with any superhero film - save the world, family issues, etc. But it has a great message about polluting the water. Also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss. And I don't see how and why Black Manta is the best villains, his story kinda flat and lacking for me. Black Manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villain.

Afterall, this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans. Also you have to watch it in an IMAX 3D. Worth it.

P.S: Amber Heard acting is trash",1
Aquaman,"And not good cheesy silliness. I can't believe the hi caliber actors who lent their reputation to this flashy junk., excepting Amber Heard.",1
Aquaman,Srupid me not to have read the reviews and cast list. La Kidman with inflated breasts all washed up. I wish her career was. Ghastly. Instant delete.,1
Aquaman,"DC perked you up...







With coffee. Don't you have enough of your ex's moula? Though your red hair looks fantastic. What a bad movie, all around. Basic plot, basic characters. The only thing interesting is the amount of computer work they put into this. I can't see why people really enjoyed this, other than the fact the culture (mind you who're fighting for the METOO movement) are salivating over Jason Mamoa, who really couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Anyone know who the grunter in film is? Well he's the perfect example. The star whose built, so you take their shirts off and make grunts. I think the message behind the film should have been more prominent. Keep our oceans clean folks, it's another world in it's self. One last thing, why was Harry Osborne even in this movie? None the less, actually a core actor. The guy has the opportunity to do anything he wants now, from ANTICHRIST to AQUAMAN, making great career choices. If Warner's had him under a magical spell, why would they choose this movie? Make him the villian of SUICIDE SQUIRTS 2 and replace Jarred Letgo.",1
Aquaman,Horrible movie. Too bad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaad,1
Aquaman,"If you thought DC's Batman vs. Superman was awful, this one is worse. There is background story. Good. Now the bad stuff: the 'bad guys' in the first scene are all black! WHAT?! yes, there is ONE reason why ONE bad guy might have to be black, but really? There is a battle scene every 10 minn. There are physic-defying underwater scenes. Has DC even heard of physics? The Atlantians enslave creatures of the beloved realm and use them for war. The carnage is ridiculous. This is like Thor without plot, humor. The romance is predictable and contrived, but was the most interesting part. When the romance is the most interesting to me, you know it is bad. GACK!!! DC GACK!!!!",1
Aquaman,"This is so cringeworthy and awful! I can't believe that people are giving it such good reviews. It's corny, cheesy, poor acting, and references every movie I've ever seen. Whoever signed off on this movie should be fired and find a new career path.",1
Aquaman,Ive said it. Its suitable for children. I regret watching it,1
Aquaman,Apparently abuse is popular enough in Hollywood that they support it in the movie industry.,1
Aquaman,"How bad is this? Its really bad and I can't for the life of me figure out how it has such a high rating. I really dont know where to start. People riding on sea horses, people riding on sharks, a special forces solider who looks like he has a giant ant head. Underwater soldiers that bleed water. Any every possible psychedelic colour who could imagine.Its was like the director was on a bad acid trip. Myself and the family who are by the way big fans of the marvel franchise could only watch this for about 40 minutes. Its a shame because Jason Momoa who I think is a very decend actor was let down by this very poor script. This character was much better portrayed in Justice League but then Zack Snyder directed that where Aquaman was directed by James Wan who would be better known for directing Horror movies and I think this is where he went off the rails. Aquaman 2 has been announced and I fear when James Wan gets his hands on it, it will be more of the same. One to avoid!!!",1
Aquaman,"I believe that Aquaman is a sorry excuse for a movie and I will not change my mind. I started believing this right after the movie ended. I think that this belief is rational as the plot of a movie is extremely important and this movie has so many plot holes that it's basically swiss cheese. Nothing could change my mind; even if the movie's lack of continuity was an artistic decision to comment on movies with a lack of continuity, the movie's attempt is way too unintentional to ever pass as one. This belief is very strong (maybe unimportant) but very strong. A significant number of people agree with my belief. I would be very disappointed in the world and film experts if they rate Aquaman as a good movie.",1
Aquaman,"The storyline is childish, dialogues are immature. It brutally shattered all my expectations from a movie which is said to be the highest grossing DC movie in entire history.( Batman series was atleast 10times better).The only thing worth watch watching in the entire movie was the sizzling superhot amber heard.",1
Aquaman,"This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script made Titanic sound like Shakespeare, the visual effects were completely overdone and the acting is so superficial - it's like the lines are being delivered by a group of unenthusiastic 5th formers in the world's worst school play. There was no real emotion, no sense of peril, and even Willem Dafoe seemed wooden. Depressing. The world's longest and least inspiring Timotei ad.",1
Aquaman,"Tell the story faster. Boring and fell asleep.intyieuce the brother before he comes in scene, and hiding the Mom still alive was reduced!",1
Aquaman,"Kal Drogo, 👍. Aquaman, 👎. Jason brings excitment to whatever he does but everything underwater looked cartoonish. Wilson's over-acting was also cartoonish. Black manta was cool but minimized as a sevondary villain. Nicole Kidman sucked. Wonder Woman is still the best DC film in my opinion. I haven't seen Shazam yet.",1
Aquaman,If you like bad CGI and hate storylines then this is the film for you.,1
Aquaman,"The first twenty minutes of the film are well worth its own movie. After that, the movie struggles to find its overall tone, message, story, and any original thought. The ""inventive CGI"" are just action clips from other action blockbusters that were actually worth the money. Some examples include the rooftop scene from the fast and furious franchise, pitch black, a sudden appearance of a kaiju similar to Godzilla or Pacific Rim, and journey to the center of the earth, plus many more. I'm much more a DC fan than marvel, but marvel movies are so much more worth the time and money. The income of this movie is nothing more than a marketing scheme by the movie industry. I honestly hope that DC will pull a new 52 scenario and completely restart their franchise.",2
Aquaman,"Almost 2-1/2 hours of too much CGI for a ""King Arthur"" sword in the stone story. It was far too much CGI, overly dramatic music which repeated throughout the entire film. There was way too much ""we're killing the planet"" messaging in this movie. My kids didn't even like it (boys 12 and 14). DC is just pumping out junk because of the popularity of superhero movies right now. The best scene in the movie is when they are in Sicily. They did a good job in that scene (only) of mixing the CGI and real life.",2
Aquaman,"It was a solid film, but the DC isn't over yet, for now...",2
Aquaman,"Nice story, but effects and costumes are for young children",2
Aquaman,"Aquaman did not live up to the hype. I'm not sure why I had high hopes for another DC film. You would think I might have learned my lesson, after the last few let-downs. I didn't, and I was thoroughly disappointed with this shell of a movie.

The story is generic and boring. The acting is unconvincing and even comical at times. The CGI is so overwhelming and obvious, that it distracts the audience. The fighting/war sequences are not choreographed well, and the conflict at the end of the movie, didn't even make sense.

I love superhero movies, and am not a stranger to movies that require a little imagination, in order to digest. This movie reaches for the stars, while forgetting every pillar required to construct a great film. It was not worth the money or the time I spent watching it.",2
Aquaman,I enjoy superhero movies but this one is just riddled with cheesy one-liners and forced humour. It feels like the dialogue was written by someone who was paid to write a film they had no passion about. There's a particular scene toward the end which is just so weak and awkward that I just had to laugh at it. The visuals were stunning but that isn't enough for me to have a positive experience of this film. I would not go see this again. Generic and boring.,2
Aquaman,I had no expectations for this movie but people really liked this so I watched it. This is like a syfy channel caliber movie I would say its comparable to a movie like sharknado. Everything about this movie is bad the cgi looks like a 8 year old did it.,2
Aquaman,"There were some visually interesting scenes otherwise it was as ridiculous and banal as Wonder Woman, Black Panther, Venom etc. etc.

It's unfair to the cast & crew (apart from the decision makers) who work their behinds off in trying to make the trite formula work albeit in vain...

I don't know when will the studios start putting some effort into the storylines instead of just pouring cash in to make every movie visually as huge as possible without any hint of worthy content...",2
Aquaman,"The movie started excellent and i really liked the intro of the story aquaman

then..... the submarine scene pffff.... lets pretend for a minute that is possible for an hostile force to actually make a commando strike (which is not) and take possession of a russian nuclear submarine and mister aqua jumps in the story to save the day all good witch problems that destroyed the movie for me : -- special commando guy scared behind a door after fighting a submarine full of russians successfully (thats just stupid) -- the 40mm grenade explodes in a enclosed environment and the two bad black guys are just fine its like not a chance in hell that happens -- throwing half a torpedo on the ground and nothing happens

There have been many other mistakes in just a few minutes but i tried to keep a my observation count at 3 , and all this mistakes takes you out of the movie as there is to much fantasy in the movie and any law of physics are just nonexistent . A good movie will anchor it self to a type of reality but here they decided to go with fantasy and i understand its a superhero movie but superhero or not there are things that just do not work.",2
Aquaman,"I heard Aquaman broke box office records, and it was going to define the DCEU. But this movie is awful. I'd rather watch Batman V Superman again before I watch this cheesy crap show of a movie. If anyone is reading this review... switch to your nearest MCU movie.",2
Aquaman,"I cant belive how sneery a kind of movies we have here, evrything in this movie was crap, costoms, story, charachters,tools, weapons, ... it could be much acceptable in animation. creativity is Zero. i would like to highlight some fails which I belive it should not be messed in such huge movie coming from a large production such as MARVELS!

FAIL 1: Atlanna falls in love with the 1st man she met on land, and for a long times they couldn't find her untill she gave Arthur! What about he stupid uniform!

Fail 2: King Orm, knew that Vulko trained Arthur since childhood, but he left him do it for long years, and wanted to surprice Vulko at the end of the movie! was this indian sense?

Fail 3: the guards looks so ugly and not compatible with the ocean creatures, its robots! come on!! a little babygirl can do better imagination for such guards and customs, especially the red ray weapon!

Fail 4: Arthur , the story hero, caould lift a submarine easily from the deep ocean to the surface, but it was very difficult for him to fight a metal ugly robot / Manta!

Fail 5: When King Orm met the green freaking king to convince him to do war on land people, that king came to me King Orm without guards, weapons, and brings his wife and daughter with him, is this an act of a Kings!!

Fail 6: If these creatures caould see underwater with supernatural powers, why they have lights in their jets, camps and everywhere!!!

Fail 7: what is the purpose of Sharks riding when they can swim faster than it, its like Monkeys riding horses in planet of the apes, pathetic.

Finally, remember we have to maintain the oceans cleanliness so the aqua people dont get mad and dround the lands.",2
Aquaman,"Everything in this film is terrible, story just skips like a very flat stone on the water surface and makes absolutely no proper sense. Character development is very bad and there are even random and completely unnecessary. There is an extra villian character who gets more personal scenes for development than the main villian character and the main female character combined and the guy gets killed immediately with no contribution to the main story. There is even a random scene of him spray painting an armor. There is so much missing in the films development but they had time to film a scene with random spray painting of a random dude who will just die. The music sounds terrible and does not fade into each other properly, it is very very random. the whole film is like a parody video for the film Aquaman, the problem being that this is the actual film. Waste of time. The hot guy is good. Watch the first scene of him going into the submarine and then stop watching and read the comics",2
Aquaman,U couldn't decide which one's worse. This or Jupiter ascending? I don't even know what I'm giving it 2 stars for.,2
Aquaman,"This Aquaman movie has to be one of the most overly cheesy and boring movies I've ever seen.

There are EXCESSIVE jokes and one-liners sprinkled ALL OVER this movie. Some of the scenes look like they were filmed on the set of a Power Rangers TV show, especially the Black Manta scenes. Just awful and uninspiring.

Jason Momoa is a terrible actor who comes off as a surfer dudebro joker in just about every single scene - when we all know the Aquaman from the comics, TV shows, and video games - is portrayed to be more of a serious, charismatic person with leadership qualities - all of which Jason Momoa fails to bring to the table. In addition, if you're a REAL fan of the Aquaman character and have seen the DC animated film 'Justice League: Throne of Atlantis', then you may have noticed how significantly different the story is.

Not sure what the writers, producers, and director were thinking, but this is an epic fail in the story-line department because they decided to basically make Aquaman a comedian and change major plot points from other reiterations of Aquaman's backstory.

The only good thing about this movie was simply just some of the CGI action sequences (when Aquaman fights the trench monsters, for example).

The villains (Orm and Black Manta) are extremely weak. Orm spends most of the movie talking smack but when it comes down to the epic final showdown, he doesn't put up much of a fight.

Black Manta is another major disappointment. Again, if you've read the comics or even played the 'Injustice' video games, you know Black Manta is a warrior with some DAMAGING fighting skills and abilities - but again, is under-utilized and comes off as a weak side villain.

These villains should have been much more BRUTAL, but unfortunately, they were weak.

Skip this movie, especially if you're a fan of Aquaman from the comics, video games, or animated content. You'll be disappointed.",2
Aquaman,"A simplistic cartoon of a story, with shallow, two-dimensional villains and predictable cardboard cut-out heroes, speaking painfully-feeble dialogue between the frequent and overblown fight scenes. The superhero genre doesn't have to lack nuance and depth to this extent, as several of the Marvel movies have demonstrated, so I assume the film makers were deliberately aiming at the most undemanding under-twelves with this movie. For everyone else, the artists and designers involved have worked hard to compensate for the lack of any emotional weight, and anything even approaching an interesting plot - so there's a wealth of gorgeous visuals to be distracted by; but there are scenes that are so excruciatingly awful that no amount of trickery can save them. The moments of ""triumph"" are so contrived and hokey that the obligatory orchestral score which swells up on cue is downright embarrassing to sit through. I defy anyone not to squirm when Aquaman steps fully-uniformed from a waterfall, or when he stares dramatically at the bad-guys through the prongs of his trident. As feeble and trite as this movie is, it doesn't fail as badly as it ought to because recent DC movies have set the bar so low, but nothing except the visuals will move you, intrigue you, or leave you wanting more.",2
Aquaman,"Again Dc movies writers couldn't write a decent script. The dialogues are so stupid and pretentious, and frankly the protagonist is this big guy who never learn how to act. This movie is such a poorly thought CGI parade. Unappealing plot and such a waste of time.",2
Aquaman,"I won't ever get those 2.5 hours of my life back. I would rather have spent then cleaning public toilets.

SFX equal to thay of Avatar and thay alone garnered two points.

Genuinely poor. I really hope nothing like this ever happens again. Ever.",2
Aquaman,This movie is good for sunday after tough rave when your brain is potato.,2
Aquaman,..for plagiarism at best and crimes against humanity at worst.,2
Aquaman,"That's about all I can say that's original about this movie. Well, the visuals and some imaginative scenes.

Trite dialogue and a stereotypical plot line, lots of mindless action and I'd have expected better from some of the actors who were in the film.

It's a good film for a 13 year old boy, regardless of his chronological age. Something to keep him entertained for 2 1/2 hours",2
Aquaman,"I wanted, so bad, to like this movie but it's just not a good movie. The storyline is very predictable and the acting was really bad. It was like watching a power rangers movie but for adults. I might have enjoyed watching a power rangers movie more than this crap film",2
Aquaman,The dialogue is very boring there is nothing entertaining about it. Story is too heavy and totally overloaded with political and legal issues. I was just missing a straight forward storyline with some good action. Movies like that should be fun to watch with a positive feeling.,2
Aquaman,"How this has as great a rating as it does is amazing. Terrible story-telling, subpar acting of supporting characters, poor script, and cheesy everything. However, what the movie lacks, it made up for in awesome colors and Jason's muscle!",2
Aquaman,Poor crap boring turned the movie off after 20 minutes yawn,2
Aquaman,"Headline says it all. The flick tried too hard with the result being a complete mess. It deviated from a tried and tested formula and simply lost its identity. The humour was sporadic at best and only worth a chuckle. The biggest disappointment was the waste of talent available. Dafoe, Lundgren and Heard are capable of much more and the lead bloke from GoT days actually appeared very capable also. But the script and screenplay for this flick stunk to high heaven.",2
Aquaman,"Sadly did not see the marvelous features other viewers claim. While I am a huge fan of the actors, especially Dafoe, Kidman, Momoa, and Wilson, the screenplay and editing scrambled the story horribly. The resulting mess ruined an otherwise fine DC fantasy. Even remarkable performances and special affects could not salvage the movie. Cannot recommend.",3
Aquaman,"When I got home from the cinema I was 101% sure I would find here only negative reviews and then I saw people actually loved it enough to give it 10/10... Seriously I don't understand this. ""Aquaman"" is so bad that it was actually kind of good... I mean it has no screenplay, absolutely no acting, no structure - nothing. But at the same time for some reason I can't say it was boring to watch. It was a plain circus, just a ridiculous show, a performance full of booms and baams...

In the beginning there was a Russian submarine hijacked by pirates... Aquaman swam around while wearing his usual rock'n'roll jeans and boots, decided to help the Russians, killed all the pirates (without forgetting to pose heroically in between), pushed the submarine from the ocean to the surface (in reality that would kill everybody in the submarine) and the submariner were like ""It's Aquaman! Hooray! You saved us!"". So... after such an amazing start you just relax, let your sarcasm loose and try to enjoy this crappy ass show.

This movie reminded me of the first ""Capitan America"". Dumb, ""serious"" (the characters try to copy Marvel heroes and joke, but without any success) and all story just falls apart. I'm really sorry for Nicole Kidman,Willem Dafoe and of course Patrick Wilson. They are great actors and now they have to be a part of this... Though it looks like this movie is an absolute top for Jason Momoa. He doesn't look like a real actor, though I seriously believed the director would surely use his natural charisma. He didn't. Literally anybody could play Aquaman in this movie. The role is so dumb and empty you could put anybody in those ""ocean king of Vegas"" clothes. And yeah, I'm afraid they will make the second part, but I'm sure as hell won't give a cent to watch it.",3
Aquaman,"This film is so predictable, it's boring. Nothing happens besides explosions. Some good graphics though.",3
Aquaman,"Really poor graphics, character development and appallingly bad attempts at humour.

Stop trying to attempt what Marvel does so well I.e. humour and wit and get back to making darker movies.",3
Aquaman,Must watch. Best DCEU film ever. Super effects and the movie just rocks,3
Aquaman,"Think about this... The Dark Knight was just a few minutes longer than this movie. Though the effects and fighting choreography were much better...what the movie lacks is an interesting plot. I fell asleep halfway through it and kept checking my watch to see how much longer the movie was. The Dark Knight, though several years older, still has a better story and is still worth investing my time to watch. You feel connected to the characters and even though you know how it's going to end, you still want to see the Dark Knight all the way to its ending. Aquaman feels like a fish of water, you know what's going to happen, everything is boring and repetitive from other superhero movies. We can't compare Aquaman to Marvel, because the way they were written in the comics are very much different. But comparing this to DC movies like the Dark Knight, it clearly falls short of the water a fish out of water needs. Boring, too long, and obviously a terrible super hero movie.",3
Aquaman,"So we watched the trailer, and it looked like Aquaman might actually have a storyline, rather than just extended CGI sequences of fight scenes. Well, kudos on the trailer, you convinced us to fork out our dollars and go the cinema, but the popcorn was the highlight of the evening!

Ok, ok, I accept that this is a comic/superhero movie, and it's aimed for a teens audience. So, in that respect it was sort of entertaining. But really...Aquaman was such a mish mash.

There were the attempted moralistic tales. First about polluted water. Next about being judgmental about other cultures (in this case the Atlantians being judgmental about the surface world) and a few others tossed in. The movie gets a tick for trying, but any decent environmental studies student could have improved that part of the script.

The scenery was nice and the CGI passable - but certainly not out of this world, even though it was trying to be out of this world.

But onto the weaknesses.

There were the jokes. Hmm, attempted jokes. I don't think I actually laughed at any of them. Next, what's with the 70s style riding on fish creatures with a harness when the main characters all have underwater superpowers.

And what about the plot? Well there are goodies and baddies. A predictable love story. And all that was really just a pretence for sequence after sequence of shoot-em-up on land and in water. And that's why it was so disappointing, it offered very little for the viewer if you were after anything more than an action flick.",3
Aquaman,"The movie was so predictable that I haven't even watched the trailers before the movie itself and I knew what would happen in every single scene.... It was so predictable that, I am dead serious, the guy next to me in the cinema was completing the sentences in half of the scenes until he fell asleep... I almost fell asleep a couple of times but somehow I managed to survive.

The acting was awful. That's all I'm going to say regarding this part.

The cringy moments where so many that I kept asking myself why I paid money to see this piece of .... art ... After every battle Aquaman was acting like a Power Ranger. Even the posing I am not kidding. I couldn't believe my eyes at some scenes. Purely disgusting...

I am a huge fan of superheroe movies but this was a disgrace.

The only thing that was above average was the CGI. Cool effects, some nice battles but not many, and awfully CORNY.

TLDR: This movie should not have more than 5 score but it seems there are a lot of bots and paid people in here. 2 and a half hours of wondering what is happening. 2 and a half hours of regret. I created an IMDB profile just to tell the truth. I have hated so many overrated movies and I desperately wanted to write reviews about them but it was never enough for me to create a profile. This was MORE than enough.... I didn't hear one happy person in the crowd after leaving. Not to say that 99% of the people stormed out before the final scene and it was obvious that they couldn't wait to get out ASAP... Don't waste your money!!!",3
Aquaman,"James Wan ruined MacGyver, so why not give him a chance to ruin Aquaman? Why do they keep throwing money at this guy? He sucks. And an additional star knocked off for casting Amber Heard. I wish I never heard of her. She acts about as well as a block of chalky cheese. At least cheese stinks. Politics is ruining all the entertainment.",3
Aquaman,"This is hands down a solid reason DC should just roll over and leave it to Marvel. Don't get me wrong, I grew up reading both sides of comic books and then some, but this is just mostly painful I'm afraid. Loose plot, loose acting (at best) loose story line and don't even get me started on the amount of goofs. Way too long for what it really is. It actually does have some minor good points, for me at least, some of the movie really does hold itself together pretty well! But for the most part, I've pretty much forgotten I've watched it already.",3
Aquaman,The story is quite good but the whole setup is so bad...,3
Aquaman,"I would rather watch some superman movies from the 80s. At a time when real actors were in the movies. Not these bunch of muscle cgi photoshop mixture nobodies. Sorry for the once real actors, who gave their names (not act!) for this misery called 'movie'. I have to admit that this one was a bit better than the usual marvel trash, hence the 3 stars and not one.",3
Aquaman,"The story was so predictable it's crazy. Black manta was totally pointless. The love story was way out of place and forced. Now I like CGI and it can really add to a movie but in this one there was way too much and it was creepy at times. Why they need to CGI a person's face just because they are under water is beyond me, it takes you out of the movie. The fight scenes were sub-par. Why were they riding on dinosaurs with no explanation? Then the trench had Dino's too, why not explain that?! The hype around this movie is undeserved. It is fine to watch at home but not as good as some people make it sound.",3
Aquaman,No depth whatsoever.. I feel like dumb people would find this movie 'clever',3
Aquaman,"I saw it the first day it came out, I was so excited to see it. So I was surprised and a little disappointed when I fell asleep twice. I wondered, ""Will it ever end?"" The same scenes keep repeating themselves over and over. Aquaman lost a lot of points when, in the middle of a pre-scheduled, public, colosseum-style showdown with the bad guy, the girl encouraged him to abandon the fight, and he accepted and ran away like a wuss?! What?!!!!!

A lot of the movie was quantity over quality, cheesy, and poor effects.

Jason Momoa obviously is smokin' hot, and exponentially so once he turns into Aquaman and he is a great actor and carried the movie.

It is visible that he has difficulty doing love scenes since he is so loyal to his real-life wife which is precious in its own way.",3
Aquaman,"While I will say the special effects were great, there were a Hell of a lot of problems with it. To start with, if they were going to use Black Matnta, they should have expanded his role, or hinted that he would be in the next one, not just for a smaller part of the movie. The movie also did not stick to the comic book, as his parents were dead, or at least his mother was by the time he was King of Atlantis. The biggest mistake was casting. While Mamoa was comical, he looked nothing to the part. They should have switched he as Orm and Wilson as Aquaman, forget the ""think outside the box crap"". All I know, I had enough, and will pass on any up coming sequel...",3
Aquaman,A lot of chi and no substance. I turned off when I saw an octopus playing the drums.,3
Aquaman,"CGI overload - Check Super predictable schlock - Check Main characters yelling every time something important happens - Check Things that make drunk/stoned people go ""oooohhhh"" - Check

Well developed story - Negative Ability to identify with any of the characters - Negative Mystery, subtlety, charisma - Negative Desire to see a sequel - Negative

Super disappointed with this one. I mean, Aquaman was already one of the LEAST popular super hero characters - why would you butcher it like this?

This is probably the worst Super Hero movie I've seen in a while. I wanted to like it, I love basically all of the Marvel and DC movies, but this one just left me wanting soo much more. The character development is done halfheartedly, and they just tried to push WAY too much history into a single film. Perhaps because of this, it's hard to identify with any of the characters: ""Hey, I'm the drunk, ripped and hard-core rabble-rousing son of a queen from 'World-A', who is super arrogant for two hours but somehow acts humble in the last 10 min of the movie""... ""Hey, I'm the super-hot daughter of royalty from 'World-B' who doesn't like her arranged marriage and can basically kick everybody's butt without trying, but I'll be vulnerable just for you - perfect stranger""... ""I've got an idea, let's do stuff together and change 'World-A' and 'World-B'!! ""


If you want to take a few hits and enjoy some very well done visuals, then this movie will probably give you a fun 2.5 hrs - but if you actually want a movie that sticks with you and makes you want more... try again. I will not watch the planned sequel.",3
Aquaman,"Over 80% on IMDB gave this movie above 5 stars so I'm glad that this movie was able to make that many people happy but this movie was in my opinion made for the kids as superhero movies really was meant to be however, with the era of Marvel and it's absolute brilliance in making even the most unlikeliest of heroes such as Iron-Man, Captain America....ANT-MAN!!! as popular superheroes as Superman, Batman and Spider-man - this movie was below average - horrible shiny colorful suits - continuity errors, immensely predictable and done to death with story line, childish humor, high pitched noisy sound almost throughout the entire movie - the production, the script and the direction all seemed lazy. But like I said, I'm happy that at least others liked it.",3
Aquaman,"Thought this film was a poor attempt to make up for not developing the character pre-Justice league. At times it felt it was jumping on the coat-tails of Thor: Ragnarok success, clutching for quick laughs and music to push the story forward. Mimicking scene from fifth element and even at one point it felt like I was watching Power-Rangers. Some liked this i guess, but it came across to me desperate to impress, more cringe then classy in its cheesy oneliners and just over complicated. Basically felt rushed into a climatic end, with no true build up over a number of good films before hand, so I really didn't care how it ended.",3
Aquaman,"I got too analytical with the movie and made a long list of all physics defying things in it. How on earth did they manage to speak underwater, and without spurting out air bubbles? I guess comics ain't for me.",3
Aquaman,"This is really, really, really cheesy. The script, story are really bad. Since the Dark Kight only Wonder Women has been entertaining in the DC universe. DC needs to start over from the beginning and act like these movies never happen.",3
Aquaman,"Overhyped and badly made. I usually don't write reviews but I feel I must take out my frustration here. The 7.2/10 rating made me watch it, waste my 2 hours and I might not trust IMDB again! Humour was below average, action sequences were boring and the scenes would just cut off and not merge into one another.",3
Aquaman,"Decent action and aquaman is very nice to look at. But otherwise, the cgi was way over over the top and a lot of the scenes are just cheesy. Like the octopus playing the drums??? Really??? And some of the outfits the characters wore just looked dumb. Saw it, but wouldn't recommend it to anyone else because it just wasn't worth the time.",3
Aquaman,"Was this a parody or something? It felt like watching a Power Rangers rip-off.

I wish I had more to say but there really isn't....",3
Aquaman,"Is it the worst film I've ever seen? No.

But here are some of my thoughts and issues: The script was the most wooden and awkward thing I've seen in a while. Trying soooo hard to be jaw dropping, funny and clever (and sadly failing).

The actors did a fabulous job with what they were given.

The special effects were great, don't get me wrong it looked good!

But wow it made me laugh at lines I shouldn't be laughing at and at the forced romance. I had no feelings about any characters except mild annoyance at times.

Only watched it because of Willem Dafoe and Jason Momoa. And I'll admit that I was curious (and my childhood obsession with the ocean also drew me in slightly).

Again, not the worst movie I've ever seen by a long shot. But not good.",4
Aquaman,"Allow me to quote Raj from The Big Bang Theory. ""I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.""

Oh, DC. I thought you'd learned! Wonder Woman was proof, wasn't it? All of the elements of great movie storytelling were present. It was wonderfully cast, carefully scripted. The film evolved at a crisp, but comfortably artistic pace, a tribute to careful editing. And when the magnificent amazon finally revealed her power at exactly the right moment as she stepped majestically onto the battlefield? Goosebumps.

So, how do you explain the obvious regression of Aquaman?

The casting is...meh. Jason Momoa is a fine, physical specimen of the fish man, but his hero is startlingly flat. The rest of the cast might work fine if this was a made for television movie, but it isn't. It's a major theatrical vehicle and DC has failed to bring in a suitable stable of supporting actors to carry the weight. And even though it's unfair to continually compare the DC universe to Marvel's, the parallel is unescapable. Ant Man, who ranks in the Marvel pantheon probably even lower than where Aquaman stands in the DC hero collection, carries two stand-alone movies effortlessly. Aquaman struggles from the beginning of the film, through its tedious center, to its final cheesy conclusion to justify the film's reason to live. Storytelling is the key, and where Wonder Woman earned a well-deserved A, Aquaman receives an equally merited D. Perhaps if the writers had chosen to meditate for two hours on the character's back story and built methodically toward a big reveal, I might be submitting a very different review. But instead the writing bumps along like an old roller coaster, jerking us through rickety rails of track, always in a hurry to get us to the steep climb and the furious fall to the end. None of it is satisfying. Instead of feeling like a big budget superhero film, the movie increasingly feels like a sad mishmash of Godzilla and Finding Nemo, although Nemo did a much better job of creating an interesting undersea world.

DC continues to give us heroes but can't seem to connect us to them. It's the primary flaw in the DC universe. It's characters are too cold and detached from the audience. It's a problem that will only be fixed through better movie storytelling.

I rank movies like I rank potatoes, because I love potatoes. Aquaman receives my Instant Mashed Potatoes ranking which roughly translates this way. They will do if you're in a hurry, but they generally suck. And in this case, Raj was right. These taters suck underwater.",4
Aquaman,"The film was better than any other dceu movie arguably however tonaly it was inconsistent the music played a hand in that, the script pretty standard. The fights had very little cuts due to the amount of cgi while in theory it should be better than over using cuts (see every bad action film). Personally it takes me out of the movie because at points the animation was worse than at others particularly the first fight scene. The costumes felt like a power ranger costume designer came up with them and that further added to tonal inconsistencies. Another issue for me was the fact aquaman seemed invincible how can i care for a character who's pain tolerance I don't know.

Finally while the film is dumb fun it is not worth anything at most above 6.5 this is my objective view (personally I didn't like it) and people giving this 9's are completely out there review it as a film a piece of art NOT a dceu film at the time of writing it has a 7.7 .",4
Aquaman,"Ever since he was cast as Aquaman, I was excited to see Jason Momoa make this character his own. I enjoyed his appearance in the otherwise problematic Justice League and this should have been an enjoyable thrill ride. It certainly could have been.

To be specific and somewhat spoiler-y, my primary issue with this film really didn't have anything to do with Momoa's performance, nor Aquaman as a hero. There were plenty of scenes which captured the titular character well. If course there was going to be lots of underwater battles and even talking to fish. All that was there. Trouble was, for me, there were very few scenes that weren't ripped off from better films.

A few of the many examples: young Arthur is bullied while admiring beautiful creatures behind glass, and then he communicates with said creatures and they assisted in not only thwarting the bully but helping to reveal his own powers. If that doesn't ring a bell, just rewatch the early scene from the first Harry Potter film and you'll see essentially the same scene play out. How to Train Your Dragon offers similar material, both in the long lost mother in the lost world, but also in befriending the big baddie (which even looks like the king sized dragon) to fight his battle. The display of the wonders of Atlantis, er...Pandora...is so very reminicent of Cameron's idyllic world they should have paid royalties. And the usurper to the throne, battle, disgrace, and redemption so closely resembled the central storyline of Black Panther, I wished that film was playing instead. Nearly every sequence immediately called forth another, better film, and for me, Aquaman played more as a supercut homage than an original film. Of course, common themes and tropes abound in big budget films such as this, but generally they reframe them into something new altogether. There was nearly nothing original in this film.

That is not to say it was completely devoid of entertainment. The third act was by far the strongest, despite following standard superhero format. The sea battle was exciting, though quite similar to the land battle of Avatar. The final mano a mano includes the requisite good guy fighting bad guy throwdown, just as you might expect.

In all, I felt that what promised to be a new take on a weak DC character, falls not on its vision, but in a lazy script that neither expands this character's interest, creates excitement to ever see this character again. That is a pity, because even after seeing this film, I still love Jason Momoa's Aquaman. I just wish the makers of this film did as well.",4
Aquaman,"Acting is good, fiction is great but director eyes Is bad and writer is also bad. Vine blowing scene could won Oscar but they didn't capture well",4
Aquaman,"I so wanted this film to be good, because I really like the main actor. Unfortunately it was worse than I thought. Full of pretty CGI with a very weak script. I really can't understand all the high scores from some people. I was nearly falling asleep.",4
Aquaman,"To be honest, I have never read the comics for Aquaman, but honestly this is what us French Canadians call a ""croûte"", which pretty much means mediocre. After seeing so many super hero movies (btw I really don't care if it's DC or Marvel, I don't know what the fanboyism is about, I just want a good movie) and actually movies in general, I had some (pretty low though) expectations. But this, this was horrible. The plot was extremely flawed (I won't spoil it but if you watch it you might know what I mean from the very beginning of the movie), and some elements just not making any form of sense with previous events. Also, the acting was at its worse (seriously, I've seen better acting from secondary school students doing a forced movie project by an english teacher). Everything the characters said was so emotionless and directly recited that it was cheesy and outright seemed unprofessional (which stunned me coming from such a large studio with some usually very good actors). The most ""dramatic"" moments were so badly interpreted that they were funny. Even if you do like the story assuming you have read the comics you probably will be shocked by the low quality of the acting and the CGI. Oh boy the CGI. When I watched it, I had the constant feeling that I was watching some cheesy Mr. Clean commercial from the mid-2000's. The movie revolves around CGI (pretty much half the movie happens underwater so obviously) and does a very poor job at it. However, even if pretty much 90% if the movie was terrible, the fight choreographies are decent, and if you like very classic movies or are with a kid, you might end up enjoying it. I was with my father who was a huge fan of the comics when I watched the movie, and even though Aquaman was one of his favorite super heroes, he thought the same as me. To sum it up, I absolutely do not recommend going to the theater to watch it, but I suggest to consider watching it when it's going to be available on streaming platforms if you want to laugh at the movie a bit or to watch some underwater fights.",4
Aquaman,Comparable to Killmonger and Joker for some reason,4
Aquaman,"How on earth is this movie so highly rated? I would happily watch Batman V Superman every day for a month before sitting through this film again.

Let's get the very few positives out of the way. Jason is good as Arthur Curry. He's humorous and much like what we got from him in Justice League. The action sequences and visuals can both be stunning and enjoyable at times.

The script on the other hand, is AWFUL. This dialogue came straight from The Room. People laughed harder in the cinema when the film was trying to be taken seriously than when there was intentional humour.

Black Manta? Complete shoehorn. No need for him to be in the film whatsoever. Despite being a far more interesting villain, they spend all of the time, energy and budget on the stroppy and entitled brother.

People will tell you that it was meant to be a silly and fun movie. Of course it is. That doesn't mean they delivered on that effectively. They couldn't decide if they wanted it to be Thor Ragnarock or Lord of The Rings.

I haven't wanted to leave a movie so much in a long time. I strongly recommend saving your money as it's 2 hours and 20 minutes (yes really) that you won't get back.",4
Aquaman,"DC should really stop trying to be Marvel. They don't need to crank out mass-appeal action movies, but should take their time to focus on story and character development. This felt like the story was written by a procrastinating teenager the night before. The plot is so predictable: go get this item, go beat up this guy, go beat up another guy, fall in love with the only young woman in the movie, become king. It seems like this movie was made to build up the DC universe, not to actually entertain anyone. Jason was the only redeeming quality in the film. Try again, DC",4
Aquaman,Felt like I was watching Power Rangers campy Saturday a.m. show. Black Manta is a huge miss and unnecessary in the storyline. Pass on this DC installment. Loved Jason Momoa however! He needs a better storyline and director.,4
Aquaman,"Have to say I totally disagree! I felt like the story was an overly-contrived combination of every superhero film ever. Felt it dragged on for too long, and was overly predictable. Although I didn't take issue with them, I also felt as though the obvious social references to do with pollution etc. were added in for the sake of it and I felt like they didn't really add much to the story. I did however enjoy the performances of Jason Momoa and Amber Heard. Ended up falling asleep about half way through, and have to say I was thoroughly dissapointed.",4
Aquaman,"Wow... Again I got it wrong with another superhero movie that was trending and got good reviews.

I'm tired of the same two sides story that works for our bipolar brains. Bad vs good... Especially when the movie is 2h20min long... Seriously?

SPOILER ALERT... The good wins at the end!

Visually it is quite impressive even though I'm struggling to validate the concept of humans swimming and speaking under water, I didn't find the acting very convincing nor the script. Action/fight scenes are really good tho.

I'm gonna pause superhero movie for a solid year I think. You should do to.",4
Aquaman,"At the start of the movie, somehow him being born by a human and a mer-person and somehow he gets all the powers to control all the fish even though his brother was born by mer-people and didn't get to control all the fish. Then it went back to him as a kid training and then something happens with his trainer bringing up his mother's death and the you figure out she isn't really dead, which is just a cheap twist. My biggest gripe is Aqua-man's brother was trying to get all the sea's kingdoms together but 2/4 he just started killing people. You'd think you'd need those people, and then aqua-man somehow controls the god and then just kills a bunch of people, and then his mother tells them two to stop fighting, which is the best scene in the movie. So overall, a decent movie if you're a superhero movie fan you'll like it.",4
Aquaman,"I like superhero movies. No, I LOVE superhero movies! Marvel, DC, doesn't matter; they're fun, they're slick, good acting and action, and compelling stories. But this movie? None of the above. The acting - with talented actors! - is like a high school play, the characters are wooden and shallow, and there's no compelling story that makes you like or identify with any of the characters. The story itself is just silly. I have no idea who is rating the film highly, it really has no redeeming features.",4
Aquaman,"This movie was such a disappointment. The terrible script, mediocre acting, and poor attempts at comedy. Black Manta looked like he should be fighting the Power Rangers (which was a better movie in my opinion).",4
Aquaman,"Honestly the trailer was far more interesting, poor choice of costume and a very weak plot.",4
Aquaman,This is like a bad overly long and boring episode of the power rangers. Go home DC you're drunk.,4
Aquaman,"I think something that goes missed in this film is the simple truth that humans are a threat to the seas. As we speak an island twice the size of Texas lingers in the Pacific made completely of plastic. Over 1.7 million tons of plastic. We all can do our part. Illegal fishing practices in Japan and China go unwatered. This movie, although only spending maybe 3-4 scenes talking about this, did a great job in my eyes of letting people know what's going on. Fantasy or non-fiction.",4
Aquaman,"James Wan certainly produced a better enjoyable DC film than the previous ones in the line. But however, it fails at a number of places. Firstly, the logic didn't add up, it was plain stupid. I know you don't need logic but this was pure stupidity. Secondly, Orm didnt really feel like a villain, he was weak and pathetic. Even Steppenwolf appeared to be a more challenging one than Orm was. I had keep Manta in the main villain but lets skip that. I do feel it was a bit rushed. There was a lot of plot holes and off topic or unnecessary scenes. Not to mention it became boring and cringe, more it advanced to the end.",4
Aquaman,"I'll keep this review short and handy for your decision making whether to watch it or not.

Like all the superhero movies this one is 1) one dimensional 2) has a terrible cliche plot 3) over-the-top eye exhausting cgi

The actors did a decent job, not great but decent. Some of the fight scenes were well executed and i enjoyed them. That's it. Nothing less, nothing more.",4
Aquaman,"Blimey, I thought it was just me.

But Hollywood just can't seem to get the DC superhero thing right can they?

OK - the Bale Batmans were great so at least they did achieve something.

But Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Justice League, recent Superman.

They are all a bit ... meh.

I mean they look pretty and there's action. But I found myself fiddling with my phone when there was a big fight scene and I had no compassion for any of the characters. All DC heros just pose around with the 'I'm too cool' attitude and you know they'll win the day with no real problems.

Any they forever seem to steal ideas from Marvel.

Thankfully I didn't go to the cinema for this movie.",4
Aquaman,"This would be a pretty good movie for a 14 year old. Cheesy lines and predictable dialogue, I don't think it was far off being a good movie, but it feels like the stupid people in the room had too much of the final say. It's like they took bits from our favourite underdog movies - such as the Karate Kid style ending - and pieced them all together. It's patchy and weirdly paced, with parts that have too much pointless detail while other sections rush ahead and ruin the moment or just execute it poorly. Wonder Woman is still the only decent DC movie since Christian Bale ceased playing the part of Batman",4
Aquaman,"It's sad to see movie spending so much money on actors, fx and all and not on a good story. I was not even able to finish the movie as boring it is.",4
Aquaman,"If you want to see fish, colored, all forms of and you do not have time to go to an oceanarium, this might be the movie you're looking for. In the other hand if you like to watch movies that tells a story, forget it all about... This is not the movie you need. Why did Willem Dafoe accepted being part of this ....... movie?! So fine actor...sometimes I just can't understand. He's just there...he trhows 2 or 3 stupid lines and that's it! gosh! deplorable. And Nicole!! Nicole?! what are you doing? I just cant understand! Oh! and spoilers? does this review contain spoilers? Is it possible? What are you talking about? theres nothing to spoil about! They completely forgot about telling a story here.",4
Avatar,"Having seen the trailers when this film came out in 2009, I decided that it would probably be all CGI & little else, so I didn't bother watching it. Everyone said it was good, so recently I bought the DVD. The film came down to my expectations!

The plot is thin & weak and basically that of European settlers colonising America in the 18th & 19th centuries & ignoring the rights of the Native American Indians.

The character of Grace was largely insignificant and I can only assume that casting Sigourney Weaver in the part was to ensure it had at least 1 well known name.

Colonel Quaritch was ridiculously and excessively gung ho.

Parker Selfridge was ludicrously 'the company man' who doesn't give a monkeys about the natives.

The transfer of Jake Sully's 'brain' into that of a native was somewhat pathetic, but predicable as how else would he be able to live happily ever after with Neytiri if they were different species?

Given a choice of watching Avatar 2 and having a hedgehog inserted backwards, it's going to be 'Hello Spiny Norman' every time.",1

Avatar,"What is wrong with you guys? I left out the story. But what are people really attracted to? I can't fathom what joy they find in the blue-eyed men and women and the leaping dragons and robots. Unfortunately, I have to see part 2 in the theater tomorrow. In order not to lose money, I watched the first episode at four times the speed while drinking alcohol. Watching a three-hour-long stupid movie in 45 minutes is a little less regretful, I must say!

Where is the director's credit for making such a movie? Filled with clichés. Nothing new. No artistic excellence. Just bare technology. Yeah, it is okay for kids. But grown people going to the theatre and enjoying this is totally beyond my understanding.",1
Avatar,"You will enjoy the movie if you have lower than average intelligence. Mind you, I wasn't expecting anything intellectually stimulating walking to the cinema; it's a James-Cameron movie - who does? The only thing going for this movie was the visuals, but even that was offset by everything else. Obnoxiously bad. The dialogues were laughably terrible & there is virtually no character development. I didn't feel a hint of emotion when the eldest son died. By the end of the movie, I desperately wanted the movie to end. The only thing gave me some relief is the fact that Cameron is 68 years of age this year; hopefully he won't be alive to make the next sequels.",1
Avatar,"James Cameron made good a movie, it's called Titanic. Those others not good, but this one is really bad. At least the Terminator series is exploring the possibility of AI to get out of control and for this he deserves credit since he was one of the firsts who has foreseen this even before AI was nothing more than a project.

Avatar is CGI applied to a very thin story. I hoped there will be no sequel but since there are a lot of people who like this kind and studios need money...

I guess when humanity will be over this CGI phase and directors and actors will go back to making real movies we will have the chance to watch good ones again, but I don't put too much stock on that.

Big companies are making a lot of money from movies heavily based on CGI, games, VR and AR. They will always push products which brings a lot of profit.

One must ask himself/herself if immersing into a fake reality is a good thing and if that is not addictive or even worse.

Artists have explored tat territory even before the existence of TVs or computers but they had a good reason. Nowadays we are in this frenzy.",1
Avatar,"Synopsis-An Alien planet is under attack by a human corporation who want some resource (no specifics as to why), located in the alien's home land and who are reluctant to move from their natural and mystical habitat so the corporation send a marine in alien form (avatar mode), to reason with the aliens only for the marine to conform with their way of life and join the resistance. You probably know what happens as it's a predictable plot with a ton of cliché's.

Visuals- Complete and utter pain for your eyes. The 3d glasses makes the screen seem darker and so loses the sharpness of picture and what's worse, gives you a headache because your eyes just can't take the strain, anyway the 3d effects aren't all that impressive. Without the glasses, the graphics are astonishing but because it's intended to be 3d, there is a noticeable blur that is very noticeable.

Plot- This is where even a multi million pound budget cannot save a film. The film seems to be split into 2: Avatar mode and Human form. The film switches between the 2 and this is bad because human form is boring and drags the film. Every time there is a high in Avatar mode such as riding dragons; it is killed by the exiting of Avatar form to the tedious human form.

The film just doesn't have any substance. If you took away the graphics, then you are left with a very predictable plot (Wall-E?). You know it's inevitable that their will be romance, that the undercover marine will turn sides, that there will be some cheesy deaths to add motive etc. The dialogue would make the pope weep (line from American Movie) the worse easily being ""you're not the only one with guns bitch""...(shudders). There are also parts of the films where only average movies or poor movies would get away with such disbelief i.e. being able to escape from an army base so ridiculously easily.

Overall the film is eye candy if your eyes can take the strain but the plot is an equal let down that offers nothing new and is another piece of clutter in the top 250 along with Requiem For A Dream.",1
Avatar,"I can sit through movies I don't enjoy for the sake of family, friends, and significant others but this movie is hands down one of the worst films I've ever seen. The storyline and plot is so unimaginative and uneventful, much to my disappointment as so many people had talked it up to me, that I got my phone out and played on it for the rest of the movie (it was a living room viewing, before anyone comes for me about being on my phone). 30 minutes in and I thought ""oh, it's Pocahontas with blue aliens."" I saw once when it came out and no one could pay me enough movie to watch it again, let alone one of its sequels. How it's getting 4 more movies is inconceivable to me; I just pray that the second one flops and Sony cancels the last 3.",1
Avatar,"I saw AVATAR today. It was a boiling 40 degrees Celsius in Australia. I caught a bus and train to get there. I spent months on a forum before that. Incremental stops included a scriptment, stills, a teaser, a foot, AVATAR day and a full trailer. Now released I have had many reviews to read which have been mostly very positive.

It is a marvel to watch. The opening scenes are very sci-fi with a glimpse of low gravity aboard a space-craft. Sam Worthington fills us in with a short narration. He is taking over his diseased brother's role in the AVATAR program. These opening scenes are actually among the most effective 3D in the film, pulling you into this story, tracking shots putting you into the steps of the characters.

I jump ahead, like the film, to The world of Pandora which is lush with earthly life as seen through pulp fantasies. The rendering of this world is terrific. The life and activity is in the plants as much as it is the animals. Wonder is generated with this ambitious creation. Cameron has lifted the bar. The CG is the best I have ever seen. Everything you have heard is true. The 3D enhances this with leaves falling and swaying branches life-like in the foreground.

The realisation of the Navii is also ambitious. They are CG but there are many moments that make you think they are real and in terms of the story they are more than good enough to propel the narrative with strong emotional content.

I went into this film knowing mostly everything within it. Hours of reading, some from the treatment and pages of the recent reviews. It is very much a family film like ""Nealz"" said in his IMDb review. There is a moment where one of the ferocious animal species that earlier were attacking Jake are seen with a litter, the children in the audience loved the cute pups! The spiritual side of this film is much better than expected. It is in fact a beautiful story. The structure is classical film-making but with amazingly new scope in CGI to express grand images. An epic

The journey that Jake takes through Pandora is lovely. He is taken in by the Navii and explores their culture, language and habitat. Natirii, the female Navii he meets while lost, helps him through this journey. This is a love story of both soul mates and with a wider picture. Existential connections with the natural world. Personal destiny.

I had tears in this film. I tried to hold them back but by the roll of credits they came. This is a movie that I have anticipated for so long. I think the ingredients of its story and my connection to this films production gave me a very emotional response. I cant imagine this disappointing any of the fans on the board. Keeping in mind that it is a family film but delivered everything I wanted.

Expect a special edition. After AVATAR is a hit, a special edition will make its way to the cinema. I can understand why they would cut the earth scenes and it works. The actual film seems pretty brisk and it could also have more padding out. You want more of it and that is a triumph for this type of film running two and a half hours. It is a good balance because at two and a half hours AVATAR is aimed directly at the cinema going audience. Broadly appealing with elements for everyone. My earlier prediction of a billion or more world-wide seems safe.

I don't want to go on about visuals too much but the lovely shots of the natural wonderland of glowing life in still 3D shots is magical. Something to take kids to see. Floating tiny neon li

fe jellyfish their way through the air with grace. The monkey-like extra-limbed creatures with the peeping eyes flock through the forrest quickly. The creature design is done in a clever way with the motion of a living thing. The action is over the top, epic, frenetic and a new take on the battle sequence.

James Cameron didn't stuff this up. He probably pressed the studio way beyond their comfort zone with the time, money and effort that has gone into this. Sam Worthington is excellent casting choice. Sigourney Weaver ads frank reason. Stephen Lang chews the scenery as the ultimate you know what. Zoe Saldana is beautiful as Jakes guide into this world and.

I went to the cinema and it was a very hot day. By the time I left the cinema, the streets were wet with rain. A warm humidity was thick in the air. Lightning splashed my walk to the train station with white light. I honestly wondered if It was my time to be struck down with a bolt of electricity from the sky.

Watch this film. It is destined to become a childhood classic to many little-ones too young to be on this forum. It will be talked about at high school by male and females as spectacular. It will be watched multiple times by fans. I loved it but beyond my appreciation for the film itself, is the the message of love permeating from this movie that I hope enters the zeitgeist like elements of Cameron's other stories have. At its heart is a soul. AVATAR is an achievement in many technical departments but I wouldn't say the story is deficient. It is a beautiful experience and the story is surprisingly what I loved most.",1
Avatar,"I will say that I have never been a fan of 3D movies. Whether the ones from the 70s with cardboard glasses out of a comic book or the new wave that James Cameron started with Avatar. So for me, I am reviewing the story more than the visuals. Watching it in 2D, the visuals are ok but he leans too much into them and the story suffers.

The story is reminiscent of better stories like District 9 (which I know came out the same year hut did the trope of not understanding a people until you walk a mile in their shoes) or Dances With Wolves. It is not original and comes across very heavy handed about environmentalism. So bad that the this the antagonists are trying to get from Pandora is ""Unobtainium"". Seriously. That's his MacGuffin.

I know there are people who love this film and I am happy for them but for me, it was unoriginal, derivative, visually overwhelming, and WAY too long. Jimmy Cameron please learn to edit like you did on T2.",1
Avatar,"With the sequel coming out, I was curious to see what the most recent reviews had to say. I noticed most of the poor reviews, all but one, start with the general theme of ""visually stunning, but..."" This primer added to the reviews compelled me to add my own review.

It is not visually stunning, or to be fair, it is as visually stunning as a windows 97 screen saver which was mesmerizing for short periods of time. This movie is the epitome of a computerized world. Any time a computer can do what humans use to it is deemed brilliant. Anime is more ""visually stunning"" than Avatar and the movie doesn't even compare to a Studio Ghibli quality of animation.

There are plenty of live action films that are more stunning than this. I feel like the wes anderson's film color palette is more stunning than the Avatar CGI. And recently, the lighthouse, directed by Robert Eggers, was far more stunning and that was a black and white film.",1
Avatar,"No, the film itself is not disgusting. It can't even generate negative emotions. It generates no strong emotions at all. What it does for the most part is bore you to death and make you wonder what kind of mentally challenged person made the film.

What IS disgusting is that the mentally challenged person in question is rich based on this pathetic pile of garbage that would have resulted in him being kicked out of film school had he ever submitted that script. This film deserves ridicule and Cameron deserves to be treated with contempt and disgust. This is even below George Lucas level, in his Star Wars 'prequels'. Let that sink in.

What do you say about this film? Morph a smurf, a kitten, and a puppy into one, refer to them as naive (I mean, 'navi'), make them frolic in ridiculous CGI video game universe and then send super-evil bad guys who are somehow even less than one-dimensional and who run around in somewhat larger versions of robot loaders from 'Aliens'. This is 'Dances With Wolves' made by a retard. And I am choosing my words carefully. I honestly, without a hint of hyperbole think that the level of this film equals that of a mentally challenged person.

So now we know what Cameron is - in addition to being a cynical money-grabbing destroyer of genuine art.

It was all about money: how much it cost to produce and how much it made. He cleaned out our wallets faster than his bad guys cleaned out his fake CGI forest.

Zero stars for this, and once again: utter contempt for the 'filmmaker' behind it.",1
Avatar,"From the moment I saw previews for this, I didn't think I would like it. Just for background I am a movie LOVER!!! I enjoy all types but horror is my least favorite. For one thing, I HATE when a trailer doesn't tell you anything about the plot. I will not go see a movie based solely on who stars in it, who made it or how popular it is. I want to know what I'm spending my time and money on. I never did see this in the theater. I waited until it was on HBO. I'm so glad I didn't waste my precious time going to the theater for this!!! ( I have a special needs child so I cannot hire just anybody to babysit.) I HATED THIS FILM!!!! It literally took me 3 sittings to get through it because I hated it so much. The CGI was good but the storyline was awful. I didn't care about any of these characters, which is the hook that makes you stay. I am the person that cheers and cries during movies too. I still can't believe this out earned Titanic!!! That was a fantastic movie.",1
Avatar,this movie was terrible woeful bad and horrible in fact it was so bad i left after 30 minutes have not seen the complete movie and never will it sucked and that's the truth i can name a thousand better movies than this rubbish and that is the truth i would sooner watch grass grow than watch this movie in all it was woeful i have seen a thousand better movies than this one and their will be thousands more if i had to choose between this movie and a john Wayne movie john Wayne would win hands down and any other movie would beat this dribble worst movie of all time any movie would rate better than this one i rate this as 1 out of 10 and will never see it ever 30 minutes was enough well that.s my comments regarding this film,1
Avatar,"Yes, the special effects in this film were fantastic but the story was very unoriginal. If you've ever seen the movie ""Dances with Wolves,"" then just imagine that movie in outer space and you'll have Avatar:

An American goes to another culture and falls in love with one of the girls from the other culture. The American realizes that the other culture is better than his own and he joins the other culture.

I'm tired of seeing movies like this. I wish I hadn't seen this one. I never saw ""The Last Samurai"" but I heard that it had a similar storyline. James Cameron movies aren't very original. The main reason that James Cameron movies are successful is because he has lots of money to pay for great special effects and/or good looking actors.",1
Avatar,"I just now finally got around to watching this movie. I had heard all about Pandora syndrome (not a real diagnosis, just what I call the people who, after seeing this, wanted to live on Pandora). Even before it came out, I thought that calling the element being mined Unobtanium was pretty stupid. How is it unobtainable when you now are mining it?

Basically an eyegasm is all this has going for it. Even then the effects are all the same. Everything glows in the dark. Their footsteps light up the ground and apparently the Na'vi have skin that glows in the dark also.

I just hope Avatar 2 never happens. If so, I can't wait to miss that one completely.",1
Avatar,"My TV has a feature where it can display a fake, crackling fireplace. It doesn't have a great plot. It's not well directed, or well acted. It just looks pretty for a few hours. Which is exactly my feelings about Avatar. James Cameron spent so long salivating over the special effects that he forgot to make a movie. The scant plot that does exist, is just a rehash of Dances with Wolves and Little Mermaid, with a few set pieces from Aliens thrown in. And any script including ""unobtainium"" as a MacGuffin is the worst script ever. I'm constantly astounded that some people think this movie is good. I can only assume these people point at planes.",1
Avatar,To me it was the worst movie ever made everybody made a big deal about this movie The Plot suck the only thing was good about it was a special effects other than that acting and everything else suck.,1
Avatar,"... fun the first time, fun the second time and maybe the third but then it wears out and becomes boring. To consider a movie a great movie I ask myself one essential thing – Will I enjoy this movie in the future without getting bored of it? I can watch Fight Club, The Big Lebowski or Die Hard a hundred times and still think it is good. With Avatar I'm Afraid it is just like a nice new couch... you love it the first days but then you don't recognize it anymore and eventually one day you'll replace it. All in all I can say this movie is for easily impressed people who haven't seen a lot of movies in their lives yet. But trust me, once you grow up and seen some pictures that are out there – and some stories are as impressive as the visuals in Avatar – you will find Avatar a nice popcorn movie to be taken out of reality for 2 hours and 35 minutes. But that's about it.",1
Avatar,"Like everybody else I eagerly awaited James Cameron's return. And this looked like such an ambitious return at that. Then the movie started. Between the crappy narration, stupid story, terrible dialogue, awful writing and unoriginal everything I don't know where to start. Of course Sam Worthington can't act.

Really the worst part about this is the writing. Everything that's said is dumb and the good actors try their best. The story is of course ripped off of Dances with Wolves. It would be one thing to take the basic idea, but this goes far beyond that. The main guy falls in love with the chiefs daughter, they fall in love while she's teaching him the language, he narrates the movie through writing his journal... I'm sure there's more.

This story isn't worth telling, it's been done so many times: evil corporation, money, invading native culture... Yada yada yada.... We need something new not the same message. and it's really hard to believe that with how PC everything is these days that in 200 years all of that would be completely gone.

Looking back on it the seeds of this started with Titanic. When Cameron used generic storytelling devices to get to his worlds. Titanic is original enough to work but this isn't. Also I'm sure after making the biggest movie ever that you're not going to hear a single criticism from anyone reading you script.

The world is really cool looking. But since it's all fake I wonder why they didn't go for it and make something completely fantasy? The Avatars look like humans with makeup basically. If I was going to CG everything I would take advantage and really utilize the CG and make something that couldn't be a guy in a suit.

But the worst part of all: Colonel badass. No subtly, over the top and borderline cartoonish. I don't know why he has a big duel with the main character at the end when they have absolutely no connection whatsoever.

I guess everything in this is heavy handed. It feels like Cameron hasn't watched a movie since 1997 so he's taking the next step in 97 terms. Now we know why he wrote this so long ago, it was right after watching Dances with Wolves.

I hope that Cameron just got lost in his love for the world and returns to the original film maker that he was.",1
Avatar,"Maybe because I had very different expectations??? I thought the word ""avatar"" implied more a world of online gaming! I was very disappointed in the cinema when I found out it wasn't about that! OK, it was about a planet in space named Pandora... please!!! That's the most original name he could come up with?!? Sorry, but after seeing completely new and interesting outer-space civilizations in righteously world famous movies like the Star Wars saga and Star Trek (complete with original NEW names for everything)! I found it unbelievable from the beginning.

After all the problems about their blue colour, I wanted more magic in their appearance and world. I didn't think they looked beautiful, not their white washed colour blue in the movie (NOT the beautiful dark blue from the poster!) and the fact that they where scaringly tall and very sluggish. They moved slow. After all that money that's gone into it... I soon thought it would have been better to had just spray or bodypainted real people/actors blue, they would at least have moved more realistic. Their ""billie jean"" steps in the forest wasn't enchanting to me. I just kept on thinking about MJ, very distracting!

I waited that entire movie long to see or understand why that woman would fall in love with him, but I never saw why! I would/could never fall for a guy in her shoes that destroyes my 1000 year old sacred three and abuses the legend of my forefathers!!! Very ""here comes the white man to save the day"" message in this movie = didn't like that! Also thought I was going to see a strong woman also in personality. Like JC created before in Titanic and Terminator. Which makes those 2 movies an extra fun viewing experience!!! But nowhere did she have actual lines to say! That woman REALLY disappointed me!!! All she did was went ""aaaghhh"" or 'fssppppttaaa"" in every scene you saw here in!!! Annoying!!! That's how I remember her! How could I else?! Is that what makes her ""native""?!??? So one sighted!

Talking about that, the moment we saw them, the association with ""avatars"" went completely out the window for me = more disbelieve on my part! I just saw blue versions of indians & africans!!! Very old fashioned, nothing electronical about that!

All those LONG video imputs/blogs where BORING!!!!!! I almost dozed off! Then the ending... we have to have their ""ubtanium""... so OBVIOUS! It's something we have to obtain....BLEH! Yes, I liked to have had a more believable name for it, like kryptonite for example. I repeat everything I said about the planet's name!!! Why was it suddenly so military like at the end?! That end fight is nearly 40min long = TO LONG!!!

Last but not least this entire script was stolen from Pocahontas her story!!! Many times even the lines straight from that script! OMG! He comes on a spaceship to a planet just as foresty with high mountains as Virginia... the sacred tree?!???!!! All I kept thinking when I knew this in the movie was ""please, if you want to have at least 1 difference from that storyline! At least DON'T let Kocoum die in this one!!!"" I opened my eyes... coincidence or not, he dies!!! That's where I drew the line! I love titanic it changed my life forever and Terminator rocked my world. This movie did neither!",1
Avatar,"recently, i've discovered that i hate overrated films..well everybody does but in my case i can't be objective anymore, if a movie is overrated even though i think its a 6 i want to give it a 1. here it took me an effort to leave it a 6. a good movie, fun, very nice visuals, acting by most of the cast. however it is by far the most overrated movie in history. the story has been done a thousand times, cliché, nothing special about it. a lot of scenes are really useless, no point of them, a bit long can be shorter. in some parts a bit illogical, and few examples (no spoilers i promise) but how those weapons were fired at full power in a place where there's no oxygen!! isn't O2 a combustible and helps fire..and many others (i won't say coz there spoilers). movies like the avengers, the hurt locker.. are also very overrated. is this movie really worth being the highest grossing movie of all time?!! i doubt so. 6/10.",1
Avatar,"I waited awhile to see this movie, and i wish i had not, watch it that is. this movie was so long and boring, it had no point to it, if they really wanted that rock so bad they could have just started mining and enclosed the area, its that simple. i hope that fox does not waist the money on any sequels. how this movie made a billion dollars is beyond be (how ever since movie tickets are so expensive/ or James Cameron bought millions of dollars in tickets).

anyway this movie is horrible, the only reason i watched the whole this is because of two reasons. one i had hopes it might turn around and get better on the second disk, it did not. and two because i did not want to be that person who watches half the movie and have people say ""well you need to see the whole thing"".

this movie is horrible and should have never been made... for a comparison this movie ""avatar"" makes ""piranha 2 the spawning"" look like the best thing James Cameron has ever done. this movie is that bad. if you are thinking about watching this movie for the first time i would recommend watch that Kim kardashin music video for 3 hours instead of this.

what even worse is cameron just copied and pasted the sounds form Jurassic park, what were you too lazy to think of a new sound?

also why is it that james cameron is the only person that can find the people that can not act... in terminator 1 and 2 it was linda hamilton (altough he was married to her so maybe that had something to do with it?) and in this it was zoe saldana, a horrible actress, usually voice acting does not seem that hard but she makes it seem like it is equal to doing open heart surgury",1
Avatar,"Avatar is absolutely amazing movie in the world.Because it's directed, written, produced, and edited by James Cameron. So many people watched it and will continue to be considered. It was expressed that people should love and protect nature. A amazing movie that could to the hearts of people. We don't know what will happen in the future. So we need to love and protect everything. This movie inspired me how to love and protect nature. It has a lot of interesting parts, which make you want to watch again.",1

Avatar,"Avatar 2 has nothing new to show you. Same (stunning) visuals and sadly, it begins and ends there. The first episode at least offered some new perspective in cinematography. Yes, the plot was it's weakest link, but it was still enjoyable. This one, I could not wait for it to finish. The only ""new"" thing was they rode some animals on and in the water. Oh, and Cameron left a door open to make as many episodes as he wants to. I predict they will be all the same, though. The best thing about this movie is contained in one phrase ""Wherever we go, this family is our fortress"". My overall rating is 1 star, because IMBD won't let me rate it at 0.

Plot: 0 Soul: 0 Visuals:10.",1
Avatar,"In brief this movie deserves 10+ for the efforts in putting together unbelievable movie full of visual effects... The best effects ever... Yet they were not that natural in some parts (Especially l hated that Sigourney's smile, while she was a Na'vi... very disappointing!...)

On the other hand due to some clichés and lack of originality in the story (which makes the movie totally predictable which is somewhat disappointing too) it is like watching 3D documentary on IMAX... I suggest you to watch Luc Besson's ''Home''... visually unbelievable too except all of it is real!...

So the story deserves less than 8 in my opinion... If you put the facts together this could be the best movie produced in recent years yet it's definitely not comparable to Lord of The Rings though... They should've worked one the story more... I just don't believe that in whole 3 hours I watched a story which I could tell my friends in 5 minutes...

If you ask me if I liked the movie, Yes I did indeed... (if not complaining of tired eyes due to my first real 3D experience)... still there were many reasons to cut some points...

You'll definitely watch it in the end... You'll like Toruk Macto!... But I had to share my opinion and tell the truth...

Wish you a nice time at cinema...",2
Avatar,"This was a complete waste of money. With the pastoral versus industrial storyline, 'rousing' speech (although not on a horse for once), you expect to see ewoks partying in the last scene. It could be dances with wolves, return of the Jedi, braveheart or any other little guy vs the machine. Nothing stands out about it, nothing makes you want to pause if you have to go to the loo or make a cuppa. The CGI may be pretty but is hardly the basis for a good film and you get the feeling that the storyline is just there to justify the computer time. There is no humour, no insight, little characterisation and a formulaic plot. And inoffensive way to pass a couple of hours when you don't having anything else to do and thats about the best you can say for it. If you're impressed by CGI with no content, this film is for you.",2
Avatar,"All I can say is after watching Avatar a few times is that there was a lot of hype over very little. It doesn't live up to any of the hype with the exception that the visual effects were rather impressive but the story line and acting didn't do any justice to something so raved about. I found it beyond boring especially given its very predictable dull story line. You would think after 15 years in the planning and making that the out come would be better than ""A badly filmed version of Pocahontas in space that looks pretty"".

Highly disappointing. The 2 rating I have given is simply because of the high quality of visual effects in the film.",2
Avatar,"It just came on TV here in the UK where I live. I watched it in 2D on a largish screen in my house. I do have very good sound quality but it is stereo, not surround sound. It probably would have been better if I'd watched it in a cinema. I think a film like this is probably at its best in 3D in a cinema as it is a big FX type of a thing.

Avatar borrows from many other stories I have either seen in film or read. It is a reasonably well constructed story but the biggest problem was that once the environment and basic ideas had been established, from then on in it was utterly predictable with only one smallish unexpected development.

I thought that the vegetation on the planet had the colour scheme of 1980s discotheque interior. The humanoid-ish inhabitants looked a bit computer generated, and then there was ""unobtainium"", I mean really.

So, after the first hour or so the rest of it is rather boring.",2
Avatar,"This movie took 10-11 years to make. And it shows with the illustrious CGI and backgrounds. It's a shame they didn't spend as much time on this boring, cookie cutter story. The colonial story's themes are extremely basic to the point where I understood them at 8 and it was quite predictable. And Sam Worthington sucks. He's so wooden. You think for a film that you'd invest a decade of your time in you'd cast a competent lead and write a better script that didn't make me so bored I wanted to gauge out my eyes. But this gets a 2 for a the beautiful visuals and world building but everything else pales in comparison that it ruins the film. But still just my opinion.",2
Avatar,"This movie is so horrible that i cant even start making a list about them.

Avatar,"The values in this movie suck. There is so much tribalism, violence, focus on vengeance, unending platitudes and lousy acting. For the money spent making this movie I hoped there would be more natural beauty as there was in the first movie; to my mind, there was very little. The acting was poor, and there were far too many stereotypes. The movie was way too long; what little plot could have been accomplished in much less time. The director said he cut 10 minutes of graphic violence that he thought was excessive; what he left in was excessive. Whoever financed this movie deserves to lose money, in my opinion. Yes, there were novel special effects, but to what end? Leaving the villain alive at the end serves the hope that a sequel can be made. I certainly won't be wasting my money on it if it is made. This movie sucks!",2
Avatar,"Bland, bland bland. No real story. Nothing here but special effects. Entertainment for numbskulls. Completely boring. I couldn't care less what happened to the characters. I don't understand what anyone sees in this movie. It's worthless waste of time. I was totally bored. Saw this in the theater when it first came out and wanted to leave after about 1/2 hour but my sister wanted to stay. I tried to take a nap but wasn't tired. I'm not sure what more I can say to make this longer but the website insists the review is longer than I've written above.

Can't remember how it ended; I must have dozed off, so don't worry bout spoilers. The movie itself is a spoiler. Don't waste your time with this complete waste of time and the producer's money. The money used to make this movie should have been given to charity. Shows how low we've fallen when people like horrible stuff like this mind;ESS drivel.",2
Avatar,"This is a story that has been told multiple times before and better. This movie seems like a big experiment in ""look what we can do with computers"".

Was that really a surprise to anyone? And this plot was done before, by Rich Corben in Slow Death #3 (an underground comic) in 1971, and that was better than Cameron's version anyway. This movie is incredibly overrated.",2
Avatar,"It is difficult to not borrow or even coincidentally borrow plots and perhaps lines from other movies. Intended or not, there is no way James Cameron knew not of Dancing with the Wolves, or Pocahontas. (he probably doesn't know about Ferngully and I'd argue with The last Samurai)No movie should constantly remind you of a different movie unless it is a remake. And Avatar, reminded me of 4 movies off the top of my head continuously while watching the film.

The movie is not even cinematically great, not once was I amazed by the cinematic nor the high quality technology that went into creating the movie. The plot had too many blatant holes and actors were mediocre at best.

If you have never seen the four movies I listed above, go see it, I'm sure you'll like it, but if you've seen couple of these movies, the story plots are essentially the same.",2
Avatar,"I've avoided this movie until now, however when a neighbour invited us to visit and watch it while being amazed by his 3D video system, diplomacy meant that saying ""no"" was a little difficult.

It was every bit as bad as I'd heard. The story was clichéd, simplistic and quite cynically aimed at all those ""liberals"" who recognise the evils of colonialism and greed. The characters were, at best, cardboard cut-outs. So why did I give it two points? Well, I do have to admit that the colour and CGI scenery were impressive, as was the 3D effect - though by the end my eyes were beginning to complain.

Had it come on the TV at home, I'd have promptly changed channels and I'm very glad I did not pay to see it as, apart from the special effects of various kinds, this is a load of arrant tripe.",2
Avatar,"It's Pocahontas slightly altered and implementing transportation from Terminator 2. Thumbs down, overrated",2
Avatar,"Pros - The acting, by some of the cast, was good.

Cons - In 2D, the graphics and real-life/CGI integration were not done well (for example real life stuff, like clothes, did not get dirty in the CGI jungle). I realize that the Navi are supposed to be gangly; but I do not think that their movements were supposed to be THAT disjointed. The overlays are rather obvious.

The plot was not done in original way. The story elements seemed like copy+paste from several other stories. The names of things were facepalm-worthy.

Most of the acting was over-the top and cliche'.

Most of the characters (including the main villain) had no character arc.

Several things seemed unrealistic (for this movie universe's rules).

I found it to be INCREDIBLY boring.

A plot device overlapped in a creepy way.

The hippie/tree hugger message was extremely heavy-handed. Just watch Fern Gully (at least you will get some comedy relief, and it is half as long).",2
Avatar,"Unless endless CGI vistas are your thing, you've seen this movie before and you've seen it done better. I couldn't wait for it to end and really didn't care who won out in the end.

Basically, an evil corporation arrives to mine a moon or planet or whatever it was. The native populations simple but utopian existence is threatened. One of the miners falls in love with one of the natives and fight his employer to save the natives.

It's well shot but it took way too long to tell what is a very basic story. If it's ever released again in theater maybe they could sell adult diapers along the popcorn and drinks.",2

The special effects or cgi was great, But again the plot was Nothing not seen in any other Western to date . The fact of NOT seeing it as a Western is completely narrow minded at short sighted. I thought I was going to see something different and it wasn't. I did not or will NOT see any of the Sequels period. The subject matter of continuing the making of movies where Indigenous People are the Villians is BULL.",2
Avatar,"Two stars is for the CGI effects. There really is very little story here and it is not original. The effects are very good just like in anything state-of-the-art at the time like Star Wars, Titanic, etc. The movie is 30 to 45 minutes too long and without a story, the experience begins to border on tiresome. Suspension of disbelief is fine so long as a story abides by its own internal logic. Avatar does not. No doubt, the hype is out there and driving ticket sales but I just don't see the big deal. I was thinking during the movie that whoever green-lit this enormously expensive project had to have been worried upon seeing the final product. The public is buying into the hype, but I could easily understand how this movie could have been received by the public as absurd and resulted in a huge financial turkey. The gamble paid off as the box office is huge and I can see many sequels totaling a 10+ billion franchise. As for me, I'll cut my losses and stop after seeing this first movie.",2
Avatar,"It may look cool, but underneath is an absolutely terrible movie. Avatar may be one of the worst I've ever seen. I would like to hear what a deaf person has to say about this piece of garbage. Did a child write it? I would like to write a nice, eloquent review but I'm at a loss. There's a possibility I've suffered brain damage from watching Avatar. The characters and the dialogue feel like a joke. As if someone went out of their way to see how bad they can make it and still sell. Every character is a caricature of a caricature. Like they took every trope they could find and then rammped it up to absurd. Just truly, unbelievably awful.",2
Avatar,"The world and story of Avatar are fantastic in the usual sense of that word - the setting is an created one with unusual peoples, beautiful settings, dangerous creatures, etc.

Here's the other type of fantasy - a wish fulfillment fantasy. The wish in this case is that people could learn to live in harmony with nature. In our world, people must contend with predators, disease, food shortages, etc. These things are very natural and the more in touch with nature a people is, the closer to these things they are. The fantasy is that we as a species can so dominate nature that we don't have to fight it anymore - we can tend it like Adam and Eve before the fall. We are smarter and quieter than the most dangerous predators. Disease and starvation apparently aren't issues for the Navi, nor the other problems more common in tribal peoples living off the land.

The second type of wish fulfillment fantasy is the American Indian fantasy. The Navi clearly embody some aspects of American Indian peoples - the horses they ride, their attire and warpaint, the bows and arrows, their whooping calls, their joy in battle, their shamanistic heritage, their harmony with nature. They are a collection of American Indian's most appealing (and cinematic) characteristics, while excising the unappealing things about some American Indian cultures. A lifestyle maintained by raiding, brutal tribal warfare, slavery, etc. On top of this fantasy (an idealized indigenous people), the idea that the Native/Navi could band together to repel the abusive and exploitative invaders from their lands is another type of wish fulfillment. With only primitive weapons, their harmony with nature, and righteous indignation on their side, the Navi can repel the technologically superior invaders. I don't know what exactly America and Canada would be like if the native Americans had done just that, but I doubt there would be any Hollywood for James Cameron to make his movies in.

The third type of wish fulfillment fantasy is the Mother Earth fantasy. I'm all about conserving our natural resources and protecting our environment against unnecessary changes, but I take the Mother Earth idea as a metaphor. Being in touch with nature does have meaning to me - the beauty of the earth is wonderful and sometimes restorative. But I don't believe that my ancestors are somewhere on this earth in spirit form, ready to pass their knowledge on or watching over me. I'm not knocking that belief to make a point - I'm just saying that this is a fantasy where there is a scientific basis for that belief. Pandora has a planet-wide floral neural net that (apparently) allows the plants to have some communication with each other, and where memories of Navi ancestors can be stored. So destroying plants on Pandora is literally a form of genocide.

These three fantasies are fairly harmless on their own, although their obviousness doesn't do the story any favors. If they had been background, world-building material that would be one thing, but the story dwells on them for so long and they are so central to the plot that it becomes tiresome. It felt like a long anti-invasion, pro-nature infomercial at times. And for what? If I feel persuaded that destroying trees on Pandora is a crime, how does that impact my feelings about trees on Earth, where there is no neural network and my ancestors aren't at risk? I have to make that decision based on the facts on this planet. And if I feel that the Navi are unjustly being forced from their homes, how can I transfer that feeling to Palestinians or Iraqis responsibly? Palestinians and Iraqis aren't giant blue cats - they are human beings with their own story that requires examination on its own merits.

So those types of wish fulfillment fantasies seem too obvious, and they drag the storytelling down.

There are also some points in the plot that actively harm even the weird messages that the movie is trying to send. Unfortunately it's typical Hollywood material.

The ""going native"" story for Jake Sully is OK, but the bit where the white guy has to become the leader to help the natives get anything done really irritated me. Of course he manages to learn the ways of the natives enough to be adopted into their clan, while falling in love with the chief's daughter, in three months. Yawn.

On top of that, the natives are pretty dumb, shooting at high-powered aircraft with bow and arrow until they get the crap kicked out of them by rockets. And why the humans wouldn't just retreat into space and bomb the Navi off the face of the planet is beyond me.

I'm not saying I wanted the Navi to lose - I just wanted them to win in a way that didn't make them look like a bunch of backwater idiots who needed a Marine (statistically not likely to be the brightest human around) to show them the way.

The ""unobtainium"" is central to the plot, but as soon as the big tree gets knocked down, that's the last we hear about it. Why weren't the humans in there like gangbusters trying to mine it and get the hell out of dodge? How valuable can a resource possibly be that it's economically feasible to harvest it intergalatically? Why was the unobtainium directly under the tree, and why didn't the Navi know anything about it or use it? There were too many things that could have been used to spice the story up left out in the cold.

All in all, the story is average, which is disappointing from Cameron. Of course, I don't need to reiterate that the visuals are stunning, as everyone everywhere has pointed that out.",2
Avatar,"Can someone tell me who goes to the movies to watch domestic arguments?

Why would a film maker spend time, money, effort and special effects to put fictional characters on the screen just to argue with each other all the time about nothing?

Aren't women sick and tired of going to the movies and seeing, and paying to see, lead female characters whose only point of existence seems to be to get annoyed about something, and in this case a mere 10seconds after appearing on screen, and spend the rest of the near 3 hours moaning and crying and bitching?

It looks like the plot, characters and art direction were worked out in about 1 hour down the pub. Dreadful waste of time and money.

Oh and its racist into the bargain.

Thank goodness they didn't make any overtly gay characters or Cameron would've screwed that up too.",2
Avatar,"I'm not trying to make a scene! But Avatar is REALLY, but REALLY boring! It's all about that same boxed action-drama movie that you can figure out every event before it happens, it's like watching a 80's action film about marines and living things that the human guy falls in love with the living thing lady and he ends up helping her to free the world from the bad men.

The movie worths indeed it's rich scenario and effects, but when you pay attention at the story behind it, it's very lame. So, if you got a big screen TV and nothing else to do, just rent it and prepare to(probably) sleep at the couch of your living room, cause all the action comes at the end, and if you manage to stay awake until the end of the movie, you'll want to throw yourself out of the window.",2
Avatar,"Be advised, Abrahamic themes discussed here.

Technicals aside, Avatar is Cameron's take on how the biblical Book of Joshua might play out allegorically, but reversed and depicted in SF terms. Imagine a fantasy where the alien enemies of some fantastical, space-faring ""Israel"" nation have the righteousness and might of the true deity on their side. In his cinematic brilliance, Cameron shows just how that futuristic ""Israel"" is brought to its knees by its pagan targets. The humans are snarkily depicted as claiming the superior means and values, but in this fantasy they are THE god-forsaken, rapacious foreigners - in the eyes of the aliens.

The Na'vi represent a fantastic, figurative version of the Anakite giants (Anakite: long-neck) of the biblical land of Canaan, metaphorically represented here by Pandora. Since the movie is from the traitor's and aliens' POV (Sully: ""Excuse me, this is my video log here!""), there is no attribution to a divine hand behind this metaphorical Israelite army. OTOH, it is a force which does possess a thematic proxy for the Hebrew deity, in the form of unimaginable - to the aliens - advantages in armaments, high technology, and organization. Not coincidentally, the human army is depicted transiting the wilderness of space from a blighted Earth (Egypt) while subsisting on in-flight rations (manna), bent on an overarching mission to seek their race's survival and future prosperity by winning the rights to the promised rock (land) of Pandora (Canaan). The idea of ""Israel"" as the divinely favored people is allegorized as an unobtainable ""Rock"" aka ""UnObtainium"". Which is precisely Cameron's point, and likely motivation.

Jake Sully is an ex-Marine (figurative Israelite warrior) with crippled legs and is figurative of OT unbelievers ""undercut"" by the Israelis. His role as traitor-to-be is strongly predicted by this. After being forced to take a swim (biblical Jordan) by the nasty wildlife (biblical ""land swallows up people and things""), he meets Na'vi princess Neytiri, a figurative stand-in for the ravishingly beautiful biblical Rahab. In this tale, Neytiri's/Rahab's character is uplifted into a stalwart and loyal Na'vi (biblical Canaanite) princess in a reversal of the historical role the fearful prostitute played in hiding the two Israelite spies sent to scout Jericho by Joshua. Cameron's version of Rahab also plays a secondary role as the infamous Moabite sex-princess but in reverse, one who instead carries out the orders of a pagan king (paralleling the biblical advice of Balaam to the Canaanite King Balak to confront Israel indirectly) to seduce an Israeli warrior into betraying his own nation. Instead of getting speared in the act with said enemy (biblical Zimri incident) as in the original story, this Rahab-cum-sex-princess gets to turn the tables by spearing the enemy commander (biblical Joshua). Her character ends as stand-in for the ancient pagan war-goddess Neith/Anat - she of nakedly aggressive beauty and skill with bow and arrow.

Among other things, Pandora/Canaan's magical floating mountains stand for the biblical mountaintops from where biblical King Balak and Balaam attempted to hex their Israelite enemies. Not to mention the high places where biblical Israelis would not only practice worship but more importantly seal holy covenants, or marriages between entities. The off-site Avatar link couch assigned by Dr. Augustine to Sully is tellingly named ""Beulah"", which means ""Israel"" or ""married"" in Hebrew. The elder chief scientist's age and expertise in botany marks her character as figurative of the first spy team tasked by Moses to scout Canaan's agriculture. Sully is buddied in a paired spy team, just as in the original story. We are not even touching on details about the ancient Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, associated with the living tree and fertility and child-sacrifice rites, the inexplicable RDA attempt to burn the alien columns unless they were heeding the advice of certain OT Hebrew prophets.

Other reverses/parallels abound. The treasonous RDA science team almost directly parallels the biblical ten faithless spies of Moses's 12-man spy team, of whom only Joshua (figured by Colonel Quaritch here) and Caleb proved strong and faithful (Colonel to initially-zealous Sully: ""I wish I had ten more like you""). Then there are the 12 human sectors corresponding to the biblical distribution of land among ancient Israel's nominal twelve tribes. Jake Sully as a traitorous refiguring of the biblical Caleb who in this revision meets Princess Neytiri (biblical Rahab) at Hometree (Jericho) which eventually falls to the circling human army (Walls and trumpets).

Then there's the alien wildlife communicating with the indigenes (Balaam's biblically hilarious donkey). Oh, and up there is a naked and feathered Jake with a crown of thorns sailing the sky on the back of a serpent-tailed red dragon-beast, holding at times a serpentine twist of hair-fiber and looking for all the world like your typical reincarnation of the ancient Canaanite gods Astaroth/Ashtoreth. Pagans rejoice! As for the biblical Ark which brought down Jericho's walls on the seventh run after circling the city 6 times, figuratively substitute Shuttle 1-6 and its humongous daisycutter bomb as proxy for the presence and power of the Hebrew deity. Watch as Cameron delightfully orchestrates the on screen failure of the daisycutter/Ark to deliver the final providential blow, while the supposedly unaligned Eywa-cum-mother-earth (Neytiri/Rahab/Neith: ""Our Great Mother does not take sides Jake"") finally does the Abrahamic God divine intervention routine. It's pagan catnip, I tell you.

BTW, check out the humorous Cheesus reference when Parker (figurative Eleazar) searches the holotank for Sector 12 (figurative of the 12th tribe of Benjamin, from whence Jesus and 11 of the apostles came) and exclaims, ""Where .. Stop. Jesus... ...I mean, look at all that cheddar."" Marvelously mocking word-play.

If today's neopagans could somehow revise the original OT story into a fantastical triumph for the Canaanites in place of their historical defeat and conquest by Israelites, this movie would be their gift. It seems Cameron speaks for all vanquished pagans, voicing ghostly wishes from beyond the grave for what could have been but never was.

Excellent movie-making, though.",3
Avatar,"Amassing more than two billion dollars through worldwide box office collections, Avatar easily qualifies as the most ambitious and successful sci-fi movies to emerge out of Hollywood in the last ten years. The movie, undoubtedly, offers groundbreaking visual effects tailor made for a 3-D spectacle. But does the movie, preoccupied with technology, unwittingly sacrifice cinematic quality? In my opinion it partly does, thus compelling one to question whether the success it enjoyed globally, unwarranted? It is, often observed that movie producers adversely manipulate the storyline and screenplay to accommodate visual effects. Avatar is a case in point. The fusion of special effects and the basic screenplay in the movie doesn't reflect a work par excellence. The movie's storyline in turn, is not very original either . There are aliens and humans involved in battle, albeit occupying different roles without actually doing anything different. It is merely a case of ad verbatim role swapping in an all too familiar thematic setting. In this sense the rave reviews which the movie attracted, allegedly on account of a groundbreaking shift in storyline, seem to be misplaced. The dialogue is not catchy, the characterization a tad stereotypical and the message all too familiar. In my opinion, Avatar is a high quality exhibition of special effects and needs to appreciated as such , but as a movie, it does not score very high and though moderately entertaining , is a run of the mill proponent of 21st century's sci-fi cinema.",3
Avatar,"This movie was horrible. Graphics of movie might be great. I have completely lost all hope in Hollywood and James Cameron. Everyone told me that movie was great. But don't agree with them. Have people here lost their minds? Or I lost my mind? I don't know.

I watched ""Avatar"" on my computer 4 years ago. I almost fall asleep. Maybe must see this movie on cinema. Avatar impresses only on a technical level. Story is very predictable and boring. I felt sort of same as when I was 'Star Wars'. Maybe it might be next ""Star Wars"" episode. If I watched ""Avatar"" on cinema I will say ""GIVE ME MY MONEY"".",3
Avatar,"An anti-war film would hardly restrict its range of viewpoints to ""good"" versus ""bad"" soldiers because intelligent filmmakers understand that the purpose of being a soldier is morally tainted to begin with. There are notable exceptions to this, e.g. revisionist westerns such as ""Soldier Blue"" (1970) but generally speaking, in the 21st century, a film that wants to be labelled antibellicist would feature victims' and civilians' viewpoints at least as much as those of the actual military. Or at least (and I should say most importantly) it would clarify that there can hardly be such thing as a good soldier in modern warfare.

And the reader needs to ask themselves an honest question: does the villain die like a true villain would nine times out of ten in real life, i.e. like a psychopath or a sleazy coward, or does he die like a hero, fighting until the end? Obviously the latter. Watching Stephen Lang's character engaging the main characters in such epic single-handed fight, neither fleeing nor surrendering, made me think that the people behind this film don't dislike the character at all--they just regret the choices he happens to make. Almost as though he ended up in the wrong side of morality by chance or mistake. And that's why this is not an anti-war film.

Other than that, there's some funny blue people living in trees and some utterly implausible and obviously computer-animated imagery. Overall, I have to call this silly. No better adjective comes to mind.",3

Of course, it also leaves questions about the story of the handicapped man's transformation into a blue forest creature, as well as the strange love story between him and one of the bluebirds.

Avatar,"This is another one of those movies that was massively hyped up both prior to and subsequently after release. And with the long awaited sequel coming soon, I tried for not the second but THIRD time to make it through Avatar.

This time, I finally completed it. And completed is the right word. Because this movie has the same exhausting feeling from finishing a game - but without any sense of accomplishment.

Even now, the visual effects are incredible. And when you consider that it's what, 15 years old? Wow.

And that's it. That's all I've got.

The story was so thin on the ground that this movie could (and possible should) have lasted about an hour and a half - and even then it's stretching it.

And whereas Lucas was adept at creating multiple worlds, Cameron struggles with just 1. It's just too CGI. It looks like cutaways from a video game. Even the mix of live action and CGI just feels forced.

Avatar,"I hesitated, almost a full month, before seeing Avatar, a movie that apparently the world saw first. And when I saw world, I mean everyone, even people who have never see a movie, or even have the technology or places to go to see movies, saw it. I delayed my viewing as it was not a movie I was interested in seeing in the first place and the trailer made me snicker at the tall, skinny Smurf people.

But, I broke down and saw it, as I knew I was going to see it anyways and the small screen, or even a 60"" would probably not do the large scale/action flick justice. Even further, I needed to see it in IMAX-3-D just to get the whole effect. Was I disappointed? Yes and no.

The special effects were amazing as was the cinematography. That was breathtaking. But the FX and scenery was only good whenthe blue people (or the Na'vi) weren't on the screen. Yes, I realize they're on practically the whole time you enjoy the rest of the CGI-world of Pandora, and I think the technology has thoroughly advanced through the years, but I just didn't buy it. I just didn't think they're there just yet. I almost laughed each time I saw them, but I never truly believed them to be anything but computer generated images. Everything else, aside from one of the dog-like creatures looked absolutely fabulous.

Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. For example, as stunning as the 90% of the graphics were, in addition to the flights, the story looked as old and stale as most of the moments in human history it mimicked. I guess it was no secret the plot is without any teeth or any bit of originality, so stating it's a VERY A-B-C movie is just irrelevant. My guess is they (or just King Cameron) knew this, he's not stupid, and just said let's just throw in as many tricks/CGI/gadgets as they could possibly think of as distractions to deter from the central plot. It is very well known to people I associate with, that story comes first, always. I could be thrown a million things (even in 3-D) but that doesn't stop me from looking deeper for anything resembling not only originality, but heart.

Was the movie bad? No, I wouldn't go that far, but the race to cover up the lack-of-story with a billion FX kinda got old and made me look at the time more than once. Not only was I kinda bored with the attempts to impress me, but I was still waiting for the basic ""C"" elements of the A-B-C plot-formula (which, mercifully, finally arrived.) The basic storyline (a Dances with Wolves with the Titanic theme – dang, I got really frustrated with hearing Titanic all throughout this film, because Titanic was 12x better a movie) involves a last minute death of a man who was supposed to inhabit a Na'vi body in the long-distant future in order to infiltrate an alien species on another planet. His mission was to bring back information or (ha-ha, like I believed this) negotiate a ""relocation"" of the Na'vi so that Earthmen can harvest a rare substance in order to reboot Planet Earth after humans did a fine job of destroying it.

Well, thank goodness, the dead spy had a twin brother, but unfortunately, he's also paralyzed from the waist down. That doesn't really matter when your mind is transferred to a 12' Na'vi body. I'm spending way too much time on this 15-minute-plot, so I'll fast forward (and it's no shocker when it's all spoiled in the previews, anyways.) He joins scientists, gets separated and meets up with a Na'vi (or make that naïve) woman, Naytiri (Saldana,) who spiritually think he's the chosen one.

She trains him while he remains loyal to a very bad man (or high ranking military cliché who works for someone so incredibly cartoonish – Parker (Ribisi) – that I had to laugh at every unbelievable moment he was on screen.) But lo! He starts to see life in the blue, becomes one of the blue and its: Red, White and Blue vs. the other Blue.

The handicapped character-turned-spy, Jake (Worthington, or, again, I should say Worthless,) is so brain-dead that whenever Naytiri hits him in the forehead and calls him a child, I wanted to join her, but instead just punch him. Yes, I get the fact they wanted to show a transformation, but this extremely-dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks was so hard to watch, it should've been played by Keanu Reeves who might have given him more depth as a surfer-dude.

Would I recommend it? For special effects and fantastic scenery/scope, alone and the inevitable ""Ewoks"" finale made up for a lot of the movie's downfalls. Obviously, the general movie public (or in this case the entire Earth) likes familiarity. I, on the other hand, like to be amazed by screenplays that took more than a few hours to construct.

Either way, I would recommend, if you would ever see it, you need to see it on the big screen. I did, and I am thankful, now that I did and saw little to no depth, I can safely save money on foreseeable future Avatar sequels.",3
Avatar,"After I watched the movie, I had a terrible headache. Later I found out it was because I focused on the blur parts of the screen. When I see a 3d movie, I want to see everything in 3d so I watch every part of the screen. But that's not allowed, because you're only allowed to see just the sharp part of the scene. And in Avatar that's just a small part of the screen. So there you have a planet what should be mind blowing, but it's only head blowing. I still don't know how Pandora looks like. After 1,5 hour I got used to the 3d a bit so I could see the last 1,5 hour better, but then the overviews of the planet where already done. What was left was a very one dimensional story.

Avatar,"I've seen this movie twice now, since everyone is so crazy about it.

Well, I'm not impressed, and I wasn't very impressed the first time either. I mean honestly what does this movie give apart from a powerful advertisement campaign and some bland 3d effects?

The story is good, but horribly unoriginal, I checked this post for spoilers, since anything you can say about this movie will spoil the plot. The plot is basic and predictable and it thus we receive nothing good in that department, granted, the setting does have a cool ambiance. The feeling of being in a lush jungle world gripped me a few times, however, never as thoroughly as other better movies.

The characters are boring and unimaginative, all of them are a single facet, making this into an odd fairy tale world of nothing but yet another struggle of good VS. evil. There's no tale to tell but the old tale of evil man wanting gold from the natives.

Mr. Cameron tries to create a complete world with all manners of odd creatures, flying dragons and what give, but it seems there is no room for just letting this world live, all the things are things we've seen before with a few modifications, the idea of a people connected to the forest is good, but old, nothing innovative there. And worst of all, the setting adds nothing to the story, the exact same plot could easily be played in any other setting, meaning there's no reason for having an otherwise cool setting.

The actors? Well, none of really do anything particularly mention-worthy, their role is pretty much set in stone, and all of them act out a single emotion, till it gets too extreme and the characters seem unbelievable, so we can easily conclude there is no noteworthy acting here, the love-scene is sweet, but bland, unimaginative and boring.

The effects (and I usually love effects) are rather cool, but all animated, I fail to see why I should like animated effects so much. At all times in the movie, it's pretty clear we have a blue screen somewhere or other, or it's simply just a blue screen.

So what makes this movie any good? I fail to see it, there is nothing good, innovative, thrilling or otherwise interesting about this movie, it's not even good in the action movie genre, where the effects gets dwarfed by the lethal weapon masterpieces (or the terminator series).

And it's not because of in-adequacy on the part of the director, James Cameron has a few good movies, the terminator series are an iconic action movie with a better story line. And Titanic still boast one of the sweetest romance plots I've seen. Titanic in comparison had a real deal of better acting (even though I personally despise Di Caprio, I must admit he's good in these roles), a lot of sob-scenes that worked wonders, and generally the themes of the movie where implemented better into a story we liked.

If you take into account the money ($280 million without incorporating marketing, which would probably double this price) it took to shoot this movie. It'll be pretty clear that better movies could be made for less of the price. Or perhaps a writer could be assigned to write the plot line, making this movie original. I don't know why this is a terrible movie, I just know it's got nothing good, so I suppose that makes it terrible in my eyes. Sure, everyone will have to see it, but given the choice of this movie and almost any other, I'd go with another movie. 1492, for example brings out a much better version of this story, and incorporates more layers and themes.

A bad movie for the price, and an average movie disregarding the price.",3

Avatar,"Read this paragraph and tell me whether I'm describing Avatar (2009) or Dances With Wolves (1990):

The main character befriends the natives, gains their trust, falls in love with one of their females, and ultimately cuts all bonds with his previous life so that he can spend the rest of his life with the native population. Also, that young native warrior who distrusts our the main character at first? He grows to trust our guy and (surprise!) they become best buddies....

Look, if you like starting at bright shiny objects for 2+ hours, then Avatar is the film for you. It's got great visual effects. The sound effects are awesome.

Avatar,"I heard so much about this movie before I watched it I couldn't wait. As advertised the special effects were spectacular.

The Evil and that's EVIL with a capital E military and corporate complexes want to destroy the pure-as-driven-snow and Angelic and that's ANGELIC with a capital A non-humans who live in the trees and flowers. The Angels are perfect and just want to live their lives in peace smelling flowers and flying dragons. The military guys are all evil (well, except for the one female troop who is innocent and wonderful and the star of the flick who is paralyzed so he is physically unable to perform evil acts any more). The rest of the troops/contractors ... evil and horrible. They'll kill anyone and anything just because. There is no nuance to this movie at all. There are two distinct groups and one is all good and one is all bad. As a 30 year military veteran I was seething when it was over. I wanted to rate it 1 out of 10 stars but that would not be fair to the fantastic special effects. With a little effort this movie could have been outstanding. It wasn't. In my opinion it wasn't even average.",3
Avatar,"""Avatar"" is a stunning 3D cinematographic achievement, but it's pantheistic, neo-Marxist message weighs it down. While James Cameron's story is not expressly a commentary on the United States as an evil imperialist power, that message is pretty thinly veiled and is scripted with shallow, obvious characters. There's nothing wrong with a bankable storyline being repeated, and we all enjoy watching a noble underdog defeat a powerful oppressor, but Avatar's power-to-the-people stridency recalls Billy Jack in all its naive glory. Watch ""Avatar"" for the 3D effects, but turn your brain off to the tired message it conveys.",3

I had high expectations regarding the visual concept of the film, and they were quite fulfilled, even though I didn't see it in 3D. The visuals are quite strong, while sitting in the theater you sometimes really feel like you live on this paradise- like planet light years away. But then, many animated animals and plants appear somehow tacky, some even are pure Kitsch. I hadn't thought much about the movie's content before entering the cinema. So I was hit hard by the foolishness and superficiality of the story, the characters and the plot. The intellectual level of the story was barely grammar school. Every little fairy tale I know demands more of your mind than this. The coarse- cut human characters and presumed lack of intellectual and spiritual development our human race will undergo in the next 150 years was just ridiculous - as well as the concept of the Noble Natives living on this far away planet, in perfect harmony with nature. And then the boring love story and the cheap militarism. What a waist of mind-power, material and money.",3

The movie is very cookie cutter, following a predictable formula James Cameron perfected with Titanic. It is almost hilarious how Avatar follows it pretty much beat for beat. Outsiders of lower standing by chance becomes selected to join on exploring a new place, meeting new kinds of people who's different than him, and he is being shunned for his differences at start, while he falls for the girl. Mostly adventure and a bit of drama for the first 2/3, and then tragedy strikes, making the last third act more action oriented. This is summarising it, but even looking in further detail it doesn't miss.

It isn't the worst movie made or anything like that. There clearly is a lot of effort put into it. However it just comes across as such a commercial product, with bland characters. Also have to mention how hilarious it is Cameron announced Avatar 2, 3, 4, etc back in the day. Seems the first sequel is actually coming out later this year. Personally I strongly prefer his earlier movies as Terminator and Aliens.",3
Avatar,"First let me say I went to the theaters and saw this movie not once but twice!...I loved it! Then came news of the DVD release which I could NOT wait for. Unfortunately it turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments I have seen on DVD. I am fully aware that the 3-D effects would not be in play on DVD. It would be in 2-D, which I had no problem with what so ever. What I DID have an issue with was its transfer. The ""main menu"" (if you want to call it that)..had ""Play"" - ""Set Up"" - ""Scenes"". I knew this was no special edition or anything but come on! Then after I hit play, the Fox logo comes on and I (for an instant), thought I had bought a ""Full Screen"" version. The aspect ratio for this was ridiculous! 1:85 is fine, 2:35 is even better...but this was in 1:75!. That is mid between full screen and 1:85! It was a joke! You call that ""Wide Screen""? I had a feeling that this would happen as with Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" which I bought. First they release the movie and ONLY the movie on DVD...wait a month or so then release a ""Special Edition""..ya go out and buy that then guess what...here come Peter with yet another release, this time an ""Extended Special Edition"". At one point I had 3 versions of this movie and had spent a total of $90.00 (theater tickets plus the prices of all 3 DVD's) and it disgusts me that they (the movie companies) do this to milk you of every penny they can get from you..including the money ya spent going to the theater to see it to begin with! Cameron is going to do the same thing with ""Avatar"" and this time I am not biting. All this release was was a taste of what is to come and at $40.00 so far:(20 for both times at the theater then the 20 for the DVD), that is it. The picture quality was a let down, the sound was sub par and the aspect ratio really irked me. I am tempted to take it back and get my money back. Very Very disappointed in this treatment of the so called ""#1 movie of all time!""...and THIS is what you came up with? Terrible! Save your money and just say to yourself, ""I saw it at the movie and that will be enough for me"".

Major Thumbs down!!!!!!!!!!",3
Avatar,"I've never been to a movie, where i wanted to go home during the intermission. But hey, the best action scenes should be in the 2nd part so i stayed. Visuals are OK, but the movie feels like you're watching a game, with a very bad story. Why create a new world, when there's no decent story to back it up? There are people referring to dances with wolves, well Avatar glued all the bad directed cliché's you can find in movies together. Just for your hyped entertainment fun. There's nothing good i can tell about the story, since you already know it before you've seen it. And those ""revolutionary"" graphics just start to get boring because nowadays games with those gfx surpass this crap movie because of the suspense en care put in the story..

this movie is just another sheep with bad fur.. and",3
Avatar,"why do people enjoy the movie that much?? Went to see it some days ago (yes, on a 3D Cinema. wo-hoo!! Big deal had more fun with 3D movies on Universal Studios, and it was 1995) Avatar is a mix-up between The Smurfs and Pocahontas. 40 minutes of spectaular visual effects, another 30 minutes of ""just good"" effects. And the rest, nothing. Just a boring, predictable plot. I give this movie 4 stars out of 10 because granted the effects are amazing, but I don't go to watch a movie just for the special effects. No matter how good they are (and they ARE), is still a bad movie if it doesn't have a good plot to back it up. Not a ""terrible"" movie, but highly overrated.",4
Avatar,"Just saw Avatar and overall, I liked it. There were some logic errors and plot holes, but they weren't too bad. The main plot was far from original and somewhat depressing; Good Natives get forced to relocate by Bad White Men. The subplot about the connection the natives had with nature and their animals was very interesting.

Pros: 1) CGI - Absolutely beautiful and imaginative. 2) Technology - Very cool and imaginative. 3) Sub Plot - Nature is Cool, lets not destroy it. 4) Acting - Sigourney Weaver (Good) / Stephen Lang (Very Good). 5) Action sequences quite good. Not too ADD. 6) Relationships and Chemistry were well developed. 7) Excellent Creature and Character designs. 8) Inspires the imagination and a desire to explore. 9) Good running time. 10) ""Good Guys"" win.

Cons: 1) CGI - Way over animated and too Walt Disney. 2) Technology - Borrowed from movies like Aliens and NOT advanced enough. 3) Main Plot - Dances with Wolves meet the Smurfs, only more depressing. 4) Acting - Sam Worthington (Wooden) / Zoe Saldana (Over Acted). 5) Unobtainium - Wanted a better explanation of it's value, that would better justify a war with an alien race. Also, dumbest name ever for a rare mineral, even if James Cameron was making a joke. 6) Individual Character development was limited. 7) Smoking in a future Science Lab. 8) Questionable military ground tactics. 9) Feelings of hopelessness for the Human Race. 10) Humans are the ""Bad Guys"".",4
Avatar,"1.Good beginning,not really unique. It was to easy to predict what was going to happen. But Sigourney was the best from the start. 2.O.K. animation but Forrest still wins.I really like Zoe from the Terminal and stuff,but the voice sounded cheesy. Lang always plays a weirdo or a stick person and gets defeated at the end when playing a bad guy. Training goes so fast when flirting like a moron.3.A stranger who comes to a far away place ,and helps these things and becomes the king or whatever has already been taken CAMERON. 4. If you have a dollar for REDBOX and ever thing else is taken get it. You can see why Sarah Palin hated it.",4
Avatar,"James Cameron has prove on thing for me: he is not a film maker, he is an engineer, a technician. Why? Because there is no film to make.

He is a guy that hires artists from everywhere in the planet and, smartly, takes advantage of it. He can afford it. He can make up any world in his mind and then tell everyone that is he new ""project of my life"" - he said exactly the same thing with Titanic.

He hires not only the best visual artists but the VFX people to put his idea on screen. Genius. Who need a good script when you have so much to worry about? Me. I need a good script because I grew up watching films like Vertigo, Jaws, Star Wars, Aliens (!!), Inception, etc. Films that are visually ""outstading"" just for one reason: tell a story. But where is it in Avatar? They forgot, they were too busy.

Want one more argument: who need to make more propaganda about ""how"" the movie was made than ""what"" this movie is about? Answer: James Cameron.",4
Avatar,"Like the title says this movie is kinda a one time thing. Don't get me wrong it's a good movie and all, it's just not the sort of movie I would watch again and again.

Because it is so long I found myself getting a bit bored towards the end and it wouldn't be something I would recommend.

The graphics and CGI are amazing in this movie and is the sort of thing to watch if your into mystical lands and alien things. It was very detailed and mesmerising, the way they created the movie was extremely good.

But overall this isn't the best movie but it does have a lot of good quality's and is a unique film.

Fans of this film might want to know that Disney land is making a sort of ride/theme park sort of thing called Avatar land I believe.",4
Avatar,"I've tried watching this film three times before and it has never held my attention until the end. After finally watching it, I have three things to say:

1. Spectacular scenery. The special effects are amazing, the camera work deserves an A+ however, that's the only thing I liked about the film.

2. I could predict the outcome of every single scene in the film, the ending was obvious after the first hour and as I expected, character development is close to zero.

3. I counted the clichés in Avatar. A total of 30. Thirty clichés in 2 and a half hours - that's one hell of a record.",4
Avatar,"This film is beautifully shot, with some of the best CGI effects(which can be done very badly). however, this film does use almost every cliché in the book, culminating in some very annoying, unlikeable characters, and a very cheesy villain who does not fit in with the film. quite frankly, this movie takes itself far to seriously for anyone to gain any enjoyment out of a 3 hour runtime. the plot is derivative to say the least, and I predicted the ending literally the first time I saw the Na'vi, who are basically offensive native American stereotypes. however, there is still some fun to be had with the amazing cinematography and decent action. this is by no means the worst movie ever made, but the clichés and 3hr runtime are very hard to stomach",4
Avatar,"I actually really like this movie, but what do i mean by the word like? Is it visuals, or something else? Sometimes of course you want to escape from the reality and this is really good for that. But maybe it's not a good idea to look for the ways to escape from the reality? May be when i think that i like this movie i might be fooling myself? Indeed there is no direct answer to this question, and the answer to this question is a complex function, which might depend on, for example, to whom do i speak to, or when do i do it and so on.

So my point is that this is stupid to escape from your society and in fact to trait your race to become a cave man?? The movie does not show the inner world of the main character and the reasons why does he make a certain decisions. We just, as an audience doesn't provided with that information.

All of the things in this movie are incredible, very deep and make a lot of sense, in fact, the most sense for a sci fi movie, than any other, But except of course for the very very general one.

So may this be a some kind of the balance to not make a movie just too perfect??",4
Avatar,"I actually liked it at first. The CGI effects and graphics were beautiful In my opinion. After watching it for the second time I started to find it ""cliche"". The storyline was bad. But I also don't agree with people who rate it 1. Because this film is clearly not a movie which should be rated 1. Also, this is a ""must watch"" film in my opinion because of the major changes in graphics and acting in that time that the movie was published in.",4
Avatar,Is was an interesting movie. My kids enjoied. They like it,4
Avatar,"It looks pretty, just suffers from poor pacing, style over substance, average acting, lack of emotive characters. Looks pretty though.",4
Avatar,"I loved the movie, in particular the setting and the theme. I then saw Dark crystals. The plot is entirely same and I was disappointed avatar borrowed almost everything.",4
Avatar,Really bad movie. Too much PG-13 nudity. And made way too much money.,4
Avatar,"The special effects in this movie are good, and this film is sort of enjoyable. Generally it is enjoyable but not so much. The storyline of it is okay but it is often boring at certain points and it has a storyline which is too hard to follow. This film is a bit too long considering that it isn't all enjoyable anyway. I don't hate this movie but it seemed like it might be as good as Titanic, which I have given 9 out of 10 and was made by the same director as Titanic. But it isn't as good as Titanic though. Also this film is slightly unnerving to watch because of the way in which it is weird. I am giving this film 4 out of 10.",4
Avatar,"""Avatar"" (2009), wow, it's about time a different movie overthrew this one as the highest grossing film in cinematic history. How does this boring ""film"" deserve such an honor? All right, to be fair, James Cameron is a very talented film maker in the industry. He has written and directed much better movies than this one. But, this ""movie"" is a very close second just below ""Titanic"" (1997) as his worst film, in my opinion. ""Avatar"" has a lackluster and dull storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a mostly boring soundtrack. The plot line behind this ""film"" is a very unique and creative one. When I watched the trailers, I thought: ""now this looks interesting, it looks like it's going to be great!"" Plus, I got really excited when I first saw that James Cameron wrote and directed it. Then, I saw the ""movie"" and, well..... I was overall just disappointed with it! I just thought to myself: ""what in the world happened, James Cameron? You had a great storyline idea, how could you possibly screw it up?!"" That's one of the top ten things I hate when it comes to movies and TV shows; wasted potential. Don't get me wrong, there are in fact some redeeming parts of the story. Particularly the scenes on the habitable moon of Pandora. Those scenes were very well-done and most of the action scenes were actually pretty good. Other than that, the story is very boring, cliched and it just drags on way too long. At 162 minutes, it is quite a lengthy ""film"". A movie like this one should warrant a running time in the range of 100-130 minutes. After 130 minutes, it just starts to drag on a little bit. Maybe if it was 30 minutes shorter it would have had more of an impact. Film Making 101: if you're planning on making a long movie, then you better know what you're doing. You want your audience to be invested all the way through from beginning to end. Sometimes, less is more! I don't mind a long movie well executed, but most of the time, long films are just too dull for me. As for the acting, it's overall just terrible from the whole cast. The only ones that seem to be trying are: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang and Michelle Rodriguez. Those four actors and actresses give the strongest performances of the whole cast. All of the other actors and actresses are just a joke. Which is a shame, they've acted well in other movies and shows! What's their excuse here? The soundtrack, composed by James Horner, does have a few decent moments. But overall, it's just a cliched and predictable soundtrack. That's pretty bad, because James Horner has written so much better film scores. Now for the positives, yes, there are indeed a couple positives for this ""movie"", the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are nice and give the ""film"" a great atmosphere. I especially love the sets on the fictional moon of Pandora, they are absolutely beautiful! Finally, the special effects are stellar, especially the motion capture of the characters on Pandora. That was very well done! At the end of the day, ""Avatar"" is just a disappointing cinematic failure. But, it isn't James Cameron's worst film though. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you're only interested in sets/locations and special effects, I recommend staying away from this ""movie"". You'll just be ripped off!",4
Avatar,"It sounds harsh to give 4/10 to a movie that was the best and most impressive visual work of its time. I had never seen anything as astonishing at the time and this movie was a CGI landmark way ahead of its time. Why Cameron choose a flat lazy story arch with zero character building and no stakes to deliver it I will never know. The visuals were amazing, everything else was mediocre or worse. You can have a good story and characters in visually stunning films. Nolan did so in Interstellar f.x.",4
Avatar,"The film is a technical marvel, best special effects @ the time of release. It is the quintessential theater experience. Avatar as a film ultimately tries and fails on repeat viewing. It can not meet the same entertainment value on home release that's the true failure. The film is lazily written; full of tired tropes and cliche moments. A film that while a wonderful theatrical experience can't be duplicated otherwise. All Avatars entertainment value is truly diminished it can not be stressed enough in other media it tries. See this film in its original intended 3D it's very much a Disney theme park spectacle long before the pandora attractions were released. It's utterly forgettable and practically unwatchable though if not seen how the filmmaker intended it to be. A true popcorn theater experience!",4
Avatar,"Usual white saviour tropes. Story line is a cross between pocahontas and ferngully the last rainforest.

It's financial success is built purely on social hype and visual effects.

White male has to save native people and does everything better than native people even though rhe natives have been living their forever.

He's so superior, the female natives fall for him.

It's so cringe worthy it's painful to watch.

The only good thing about the movie is the visual effects.

But i don't this series will last the test of time.

A film purely built on visual effects and nothing else, becomes worthless as visual effects improve. This movie is nothing more than overhyped social marketing trick.",4
Avatar,"Pros: 1. effects are very nice, groundbreaking stuff. 2. think of 3D as multiplying the above point by 100. 3. setting seems very real, maybe more so than the reality we live in.

Cons: 1. how many times have you seen this plot being made into a movie? 2. stereotypes are everywhere. 3. ditto with clichés. 4. ending was too predictable. 5. script could have been tossed together by anyone that has watched a few movies. 6. pure entertainment & eye candy, no brain required.

if you still don't get what i'm getting at, think of it this way:

think of a poker movie. poor dude with little or no experience playing live. casino 'war' happens. he trains. a tournament pops up with the antagonist playing in it. they both get to final table. last hand. he is behind in chips, but ends up winning anyways.

bottom line: you owe it to yourself to watch it in imax or blu-ray. here's an idea, watch district 9 right after this.",4
Avatar,"I find myself agreeing with iamthegreenfairy (earlier review)about some aspects of the film, even more so. Certainly wouldn't pay money to see this one (didn't seen Titanic until it came on TV, and still didn't watch it all). However, a friend had the DVD and we watched it.

Some intro aspects were good (as a disabled Vet, I could identify with the beginning scene and VA hospital flash-backs), but there was a lack of completeness - especially for $500M (you have to be kidding?).

I could not bring myself to watch even clips of the movie after it was over. It simply wasn't worth it. So I'm ""hardcore"" and don't see the 3D version, fine.

I like many kinds of films and have a library of over 500 DVD's, but this one I would not buy. It simply didn't captivate me. The last Star Trek movie was wonderful, although wrong in many aspects (I know, new time-line), but still I watched the whole film at least 5-6 times and have the DVD.

Maybe this is one for the masses and I lead a sheltered life, but more than 5 stars it simply isn't worth.

Star Wars (1977) was outstanding and I remember seeing it for the first time (I have this DVD too). Yet the only comparison is outer space, aside from that there's nothing.

Ciao,",4
Avatar,"First of all I really wanted to dislike this movie, when i sat down to watch it. I thought it will be only about the effects, because all i heard in these weeks, was: ""OMG Avatar is so mind-blowing, all those effects wow, it was awesome."" I thought this will be a dandy little eye-candy nothing more. And i was wrong, i give it that much. It managed to entertain me, and made me realize it has soul and brain too. But it also made me realize that Mr Cameron wants to be an UFO, more exactly a Navi too. Because he neglected everything human in this movie. All the scenes with REAL, flesh and bone actors were rushed, you could almost hear ""get over with this quickly, so we can add another CGI bush or somethin to the next scene"", and almost see how unconfortable he probably was when it came to REAL things... All the shiny effects... It sure was mind-blowing. It sure was fun. Once. But if this is the future of movie-making, i am not interested, i am still a HUMAN not a Navi or alien or anything, i would like to see REAL things in a movie. At least once in a hour..... But i really liked how slowlike and smooth the movie went. It took its time to discover the fauna and flora of the planet, even a National Geographic or Discovery Chanel movie couldn't do that better. But the conflict was too simple. I mean all the navis, even the one who looked aggressive at first, turned out to be nice, and all the leaders of the humans (corporate-guy, marine chief-guy, etc) seemed completely heartless. Well all things said and done, this is a good movie, but i still prefer human emotions, actors, real, flesh and bone things over aliens any day. And i am an avid sci-fi fan....Nuff said.",4
Avatar,"Does no-one realise this movie is just Fern Gully reincarnated? I mean, Fern Gully - A human who was sent to destroy the fairies' homes transforms to their size, meets the fairies and learns that the forest should not be destroyed. The fairies then find out about how he was meant to destroy the forest, they are mad until he redeems himself by saving them all.

Sound familiar?

Now let me introduce you to Avatar.

A man, who is part of the human race trying to take down the natives' mother tree, is ""transformed"" (has an avatar) into one of them. He falls in love with one of them. He then realises that they shouldn't cut down the mother tree, because he learns about their culture etc. The natives find out he was one of the people trying to destroy their mother tree and get angry, but he redeems himself by saving them.

The only thing different between these two movies is Avatar has more explosions and no humorous bats voiced by Robin Williams.",4
Avatar,"There's a lot of clumsy plot details, and it's hard to get over how stupid some of these people look. If it was one hour shorter, it would get a 5 from me, I don't get why people like this film so much, this one was just meh, it was beautiful to look at but the story was pretty ill-conceived, and I don't think they accomplished what they were trying to do. And it was super bloated, it could shave off an easy 60 minutes, while not everything about this movie is bad, it's definitely a weaker endeavor, and it doesn't help that James Cameron is super petty and rereleased it in China so it would make more money, it's 12 years old. But at least I don't have to watch it again",4
Avatar,"OK to be short Effects: 8 -really nice effects and vivid colors, but nothing more than animation Story: 1 - very shallow movie and mix of Dancing with the wolves, Rambo, Jurassic Park and some more Behind: 0 - A really flat US history of violence, revolt and nothing more, full of military jargon and some terror links. Performance: 2- Hey a cartoon movie, where all cartoons make really ""native"" and ""naive"" faces. Sci-fi: 0 - nothing original, actually horrible lack of fantasy and the fantasy self is abused

Result: The problem is that the movie will be not watchable at DVD at all, but I really do not think that the money to spend pays.",4
Avatar,"Seen it at the time, almost completely forgot it. The main thing I remember is the blue avatars and the trees thing. If it were better, should have remembered more than that (comparing it with other movies). Also, don't feel the urge to rewatch it.

Take out the marketing hype and the special effects, and the story is just a B type Sci Fi, with some sentimental elements included. It really does not feel like ""wow, what if this were true... the possibilities..."". The mind is resting with this one, and it is not a compliment.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Directed by James Cameron, an action movie is a sequel to the first Avatar movie from 2009. While the first part is definitely a must-see, The Way of Water was pretty disappointing. The plot was just confusing and I am still not quite sure what was the point of that film. Sure, Jake has to protect his family so he seeks help from other communities. But what lead to that? It all happened so fast even though the movie was long. Too long. I'm gonna admit, it didn't feel long, but at some point I just gave up and went to sleep. Although, the movie has a few good pieces. For example, the music wasn't too bad, Neytiri's song was actually enjoyable and I really liked it. The special effects were absolutely breathtaking and amusing, I definitely can't complain about that. The Avatars and Pandora are beautiful and the action scenes were pretty realistic. The acting was fantastic. I'm surprised at how well someone could portray a furry. The actors did a great job and played their characters perfectly. We've got an emo teen daughter (who was by the way played by a seventy-three year old actress), an edgy son, an annoying baby sister and the eldest brother accompanied by a strict father and a loving mother, both ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of their children. And I need to mention once again that Jack Champion portrayed Spider really well. I actually believe that he's a furry.

Overall, the film wasn't the best and definitely not what I was expecting. Not after the original Avatar movie. I wouldn't watch it again.",1

Avatar: The Way of Water,"13 years.... 13 years and the best that James Cameron, the man behind Terminator 1 and 2 amd Aliens can come up with was poorly implemented HFPS and better looking water. He seriously looked at those youtube videos the put 60 fps in movie scenes and actually thought ""wow this looks super cool"" and decided to put in scenes that don't fit that frame rate possibly on a coin flip at random.

When I first heard that avatar 2 was being announced I thought that the worst thing that could happen to it was that it wouldn't bring back the magic that the first movie had. I never could've in a million years be prepared for the worst possible scenario to play out.

The reason why games work better in high fps is because people playing the games would be able to respond more accordingly with everything on screen, that is not the case for a film. The action and the dialogue scenes in this movie fly by so brief and quickly and looked so unnatural like that I couldn't absorb what is happening. And it's never consistent, one minute it is hyper as chihuahua on Crack and the next it is absolutely choppy. I guess to make the dialouge scenes give more space to breath but when the hfps is implemented is absolute random.

It is a shame too because there are some breathtaking images in this movie but are marred by this horrible new experiment. By the time that the final action scene kicked in my mind was just absolutely done. I stopped paying attention to the story and was just focused too much on trying to process the visuals to the point where my brain was actually physically hurting.

Please don't give James Cameron any more money, please don't make this movie a success. Petition your government to ban this film from the public consciousness. If this movie actually succeeds on the back of this high fps in movies meme then there is no telling what damage this will do to cinema going forward.

And I give this a 2/10.",1

Following interesting first 10 minutes it just seemed like an inferior copy of the original, albeit with new scenery & characters. There were around 20 customers sat within hearing distance of me and 12 departed within first hour. I did suffer to the end but wish Mr Cameron had used at least some of his budget to issue The Abyss & True Lies on Bluray, at least those movies were worth repeated viewing.

Avatar: The Way of Water,"I have never felt that frustrated in any movie. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk. Don't expect anything good from this movie. The director must have lost his mind, didn't they guys check the final cut before release?

No story, no plot, and nothing compared to the first Avatar. The first one was a piece of art and this one is just an unnecessary fart. A fart from another planet.

Pros: The Name only Cons: Everything from the beginning was so good to realize how stupid we were as audiences that we waited for something to happen, I'm sorry I'm not sure about the end because it was so hard to sit for another minute, my limit for tolerance has already been exhausted after watching the first half, but even the stupid commercials look more logical than the AVATAR.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"It's amazing how easy they have killed the potential of the first avatar movie in this release. Avatar 2022 is like a Rambo and predator, too many shots, fire and violalnce with FX taken from avatar. Even the level of Fx can't compensate for the story

I can't quite understand what they're fighting for. What is the goal of the main torturer. An excess of violence created for the sake of squeezing tears

Halfway through the movie I wanted to leave the cinema. Tragic movie story, no consistency in the post-action. Mysticism was scalped. Classic shooter tearjerker.

Don't go to the cinema for it.

It is the end of saga for me.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"There's a special kind of cinematic purgatory reserved for films so utterly devoid of merit that finishing them feels like scaling a mountain blindfolded. Sadly, the recent remake falls squarely into this category.

The film drags emphasizing whaling and animal cruelty in a way that feels exploitative rather than enlightening. It's a relentless assault on the senses, hammering home the same message with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.

One can't help but wonder where a decade of development went. The story, a pale imitation of its predecessor, could easily be condensed into a lean and impactful hour-and-a-half. Instead, we're subjected to a bloated two-plus-hour slog that feels like a desperate attempt to justify its own existence.

There's a sense of missed opportunity that hangs heavy in the air. The original film resonated with audiences because it explored complex themes with nuance and depth. This remake, however, offers nothing new to the conversation. It simply retreads familiar ground, all the while bombarding viewers with graphic imagery that feels more gratuitous than necessary.

The filmmaking itself is uninspired. The visuals lack any kind of aesthetic punch, and the performances are phoned-in at best. It feels like a paint-by-numbers exercise, devoid of any genuine passion or creativity.

Ultimately, this remake is a colossal waste of time. It offers nothing new, fails to recapture the magic of the original, and actively detracts from its legacy. Save yourself the frustration and skip this cinematic shipwreck entirely. There are countless other films out there that deserve your attention and time. Choose wisely.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I was a big fan of the original Avatar. I remember watching it at the cinema upon its release and loving it. I got the DVD and watched it many times too. When the internet sort of turned on Avatar and it became trendy to crap all over it, I was still in the camp that supported it and was always looking forward to the sequel.

When the official trailer dropped after 100s of fake fan made trailers, naturally I was excited. I went to my local cinema on the first day it was available and was ready for another epic movie. However I left feeling as though I had seen one of the worst sequels ever made.

Its clear that James Cameron was so focused on the cinematography and special effects that he neglected the writing. The plot of this movie was probably thought up in half a day or less. The action of this film is just generic and boring to watch. In many of the fight scenes at the end of the movie, its not even clear who is fighting who since all the avatars look exactly the same.

I will admit the first hour was enjoyably and I did actually like it. But it feels like Jake does a complete 180 after this and just abandons his tribe and runs away to the ocean leaving his people to just fend for themselves against the humans I guess.

I thought that the Colonel was a good villain in the first movie but I didn't need to see him again here and for the next movies. It also makes any death in avatar now feel pointless since they can just bring them back in a new avatar body. What made him a good villain in the first place was that despite being in a deadly world, he was still a threat without the need of an avatar body. Also what about the unobtainium? It never gets mentioned once in this movie despite that being the main reason for the humans being on Pandora in the first place. I get that they are trying to colonize the planet now, but nobody is interested in unobtainium now?

Avatar 2 is just a long boring movie that has no plot and distracts you with the special effects. The characters are just bland and forgettable and I have no desire to see where they go in the next sequels.

1 star out of 10.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"It's the worst sequel ever. Doesn't make any sense, no build up of nothing not the characters nor the story. Of course the special effects are something but you need a plot.. those fishermen badguys were a joke, ""I can't believe I'm tied up again"" well so can't we!! The navi are suposed to have an intimate relationchip with nature and their land but oh we're sea people now and no one cares!? So many plot holes, so many forced action scenes, dude why? What was the point of it all? We already know humannity sucks, killing an alien whale for a flask of Juice? A bit much Absolute waste of money, not mine for going but the one spend doing it. It's an awful awful nosense.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Same garbage. Ten years later however this time audiences are used to good special effects so they don't get away with it a lacking story yet again. The only difference is that they're flexing their water visuals now.

This is a pathetic excuse of a movie. It's like the first avatar but this time worse because it actively insults the audience's intelligence by thinking they can still milk this franchise now when audiences have gotten used to good special effects. They should've milked it just after the first movie but they didn't and now they expect you to be even dumber than them and to eat it up now.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"1, the human child was pretty much the enemy the whole time and resulted in every stuff up 2, why did they move to another clan clearly bringing with them destruction 3, now they have the memory usb death means nothing, so might have well let the bad guy drown and just bring back 20 of him 3, acting was just bad, especially the children, biologist and whale hunter 4, what about the mineral they were after in the first movie and why is earth now about to die 5, the whale goo is just bs essentially considering it's only worth $80 mill. Yachts are worth more So much more I just can't fit in here.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I have been a huge James Cameron fan ever since his Terminator 2, True Lies, and Titanic. I found the first Avatar to be enjoyable but highly forgettable, with a story that mixed Poncahontas with Apocalypse Now.

The long awaited sequel, The Way of Water, is nothing but a very long and very bloated sequel that doesn't really expand the story of the original Avatar and merely exists for James Cameron to use a record busting $400 million budget with a story that is far too long, and far too dull to really expand the Avatar audience.

It's fifteen years later, with Jake Sully and his family living on Pandora, Colonel Quarrich returns this time as a Navi warrior hellbent on revenge for his death at the 'end of the original Avatar, after the RDA returns to Pandora to continue their mission from the first film, Sully takes his family from his rainforest villiaage to live among the seaclan of Pandora.

The ending is a direct ripoff of Waterworld, with watercraft, submarines and a sinking ship (reminiscent of the Titanic) with machine guns blaring all while it takes nearly two and a half hours to get to the real action.

This is simply a one hour film that has been dragged out to well over three hours. The middle portion was downright so dull I checked my watch over a dozen times. I literally struggled to stay awake and while the 3D visual effects are impressive, the effects get old fast and the story is downright BORING at times.

All in all we waited for over a decade for an Avatar sequel that is definitely SUBPAR to the original! Wait for this on Disney Plus instead!",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Well, my reaction to this way over-long movie was exactly as I figured it would be. This is worse than the original. Avoid at all costs. The first was a major disappointment and over produced. This one is worse. It is a result of the swollen ego of its director and producer. Younger people often complain about a movie being 'too long', unless it is one of those superhero movies that can go on and on and on. Well, this one does - way too long for a movie so short on plot. However, watch the box office take of this turkey since the younger crowd seems to think that this is classic film making. Avoid. Avoid Avoid.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,This movie is nothing but regurgitated items from the first film. 20 minutes and then I'm ready to shut it off. How disappointing. Like you really could t think of any new material? You used caractirs that were dead and made them like the natives. I just can't believe you wait this long to make a movie and think you can pass off some kind of crap and than have more sequels already made like. Take for instance this review system now. You need to say 500 words to submit. How residuals is that. There is nothing good about this movie. Save your time and watch something else because you will be left feeling like you just wasted 3 hours of your life. They basically made an entire movie re explaining the first movie.,1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Cameron and his anti-human lunacy got tiresome very quick, space whales that are smarter than humans and can compose songs and write books.... pathetic stuff really.

This joke of a movie also had so many plot holes it's astounding, HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY NEED SULLY IN THEIR SIGHTS TO ACTUALLY TAKE A SHOT AND KILL HIM? ...can't have that though, right? So predictable and lacking any form of suspense and gravity.

One of the disposable son characters does finally go down but it took so much automatic gunfire that the marine avatars expended all their ammo!? Some good visuals though the aquatic cat-men are quite disturbing and ugly in comparison to the other ones.

The best thing the cast had to say about this film is that ""it's avatar on steroids"".....steroids are not good.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I just don't get it. None of the plot of the movie actually makes sense. I guess it was pretty at times and decent production value. But they literally just rehashed a tiny small part of the original movie: the villain vs the hero. That was pretty much the whole movie. They couldn't even be bothered to invent new characters.

I failed to develop any attachment to the characters. The emotions felt empty and forced. The lines were pretty cheesy. Just another story of pure evil vs pure good, with no nuance at all. Basically just some revenge gore. Some of the avatars were cute I guess. In the end, the lack of story took away from the majesty of the world they created with the original film.

I honestly wish I didn't waste the three hours of my life.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Movie is painfully slow. In Avatar 2 you can have a visual treat, CGI and Visual Graphics were top class. But screenplay is utter waste. Jake sully throws out the land what they fight for in Avatar and he never wants to fight till the end. But the end will consume 3 hours of your time. Story was pointless, after first half an hour you may lose track. Music and BGM was not class only you can hear loud noise. Movie might need to trimmed as lot of screen time consumed without any dialogues. You can watch only if you want to see the James Cameron water world type of story. Let's hope Avatar 3 will meet our expectations.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I didn't like the first Avatar and I was skeptical about watching this one.... and I was right!

This movie is so empty and cold which the director prefer the technical demonstration of the new technology and cool CGI rather than telling a good story.

This movie is about going to cinema spend money to watch a beautiful CGI set up until overdose! !

I didn't either hate or like any character just everything feels blue and cold! Maybe a scene or 2 had some impact but I felt so disconnected from the stupid story!

Avatar The way of Water is just like a good package for a crap food, I'm surprised how they managed to gain so much money for a horrible product! And No I didn't watch it at the closest Cinema I didn't want to waste my money!",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I wish I didn't own this movie, because I will never re-watch it. It could have been an hour long. Instead it was 3 hours of revenge.

The bad guy from the first movie shows back up and is the bad guy for this entire film too. (Wish that would have been in the preview.)

But now he has been bioengineered to be Na'vi and he watches a video from his predecessor and is evil for this entire film just like the guy that was murdered the first go around.

Worse they spent 2 hours chasing around (kids) and trying to kill them, while trying to get the dad to sacrifice himself for his family. Eventually they do kill 1 of the kids.

And the antagonist gets rescued from drowning even after all of the bad he perpetrated.

I see someone literally pushing (save the whales) with the (Tulkun) think giant water monster whose mouth opens up like the vampires in the last Blade movie!

If I would have paid to watch this garbage in the theater, I would have walked out halfway through, it was that bad.

Not sure who thought it was a good idea to hold kids hostage, hold a knife to a kids throat and try to murder them for 2/3 of the movie.

Imagine for me if these Na'vi would have been BLM - you would have had rioting in the streets. Its not okay, just because they're blue!

Avatar: The Way of Water,"If you have a copy and past personality, like popular things just because they're popular, or are incapable of thinking freely then thus is the movie for you. All I'll give it is its barely better than the first, but that is misleading. I would give the original movie a 0 out of 10 and this one a 0.3 out of 10. It pains me deep inside knowing that these two movies are some of the highest grossing movies ever. The movie is completely predictable, I knew the ending maybe 10 minutes into the movie. I very very highly suggest you save your money and use it for something more worth it, for example, literally anything else.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"1. No Story at all.

2. Lact the goal.

3. Caotic action scenes.

4. Better to go see an aquarium than this movie or do boating or scuba if at all we have to watch see animals this movie shows and these movie people enjoy doing fun in water.

5. Now i know why they delayed this sequel so long almost 14 years coz they didn't had any story at all to continue and plus they can't make up a proper one even in these 14 years 6. US Army Navy drama vs some alien soups already got bored with so many already out there. Enough please !!!!

7. First part they were after ultranium, second part after whale fluid, now third part some other stuff...Boring !!!

8. Atleast 14 years ago first part was fun coz it was wonder to see those scenematic creatures during that time but now even after 14 years he is trying to show the same thing no timely updates and upgrades.

9. Spoiler alert: Waste of Time Plus Bad mood after wattching this movie.. Spending almost 4hours with theater ads and drink break

10. In Conclusion: I wasted my time, money and damage my mood. You please Don't.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"It was visually enchanting but storyline was so average so poor, so disappointing. In short, the War & the cause was too small compared to the first avatar. The whole idea was to hide with his family until the War came at home. Extremely poor storyline.

The missing element was purpose & the fight for purpose. First movie had a purpose to save the people & their culture from intruders but this one was just about 6 people running from a single enemy and the bunch of ships. I can't emphasize enough how poor the story, the impact & the idea was. 3 hours totally wasted. I was a fan of the first avatar but James Cameron literally disappointed.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I really did not connect with any character in this movie. My memory of the characters was from the very first movie which delivered fantastic performances by everyone. Avatar 2 failed to meet the expectations of what makes a good sequel, which it sadly is not.

This movie is a rehash of the first. The dead bad guy, whom we were so happy to see dead, is back again, this time in an Avatar body. So back to square one, as it obliterated the fantastic climactic ending of the first one by resurrecting the bad guy. This is lazy and unimaginative story telling.

The attack on Sully by the predator Thanator has parallels with the way the giant shark-like creature attacks his son in the new movie.

In the first movie, the humans take down 'home tree', with which the Navi were deeply connected. Well, in the second outing of Avatar, the humans take down a whale to extract precious liquid from its brain. Does 'unobtanium' ring a bell from Avatar?

In the first movie, Neytiri kills the bad guy. He gets resurrected. In this movie, Sully kills the bad guy, and to save you the two year wait, he gets resurrected again. So now this is a viscous cycle of the same good vs bad guy in different settings and in different environments.

If you want to watch it, appreciate the graphics in the movie, but apart from that, I really did not connect with any character. Let's see what Avatar 3 does in 2024.",1
Avatar: The Way of Water,"James Cameron's new ocean themed project is visually impressive as expected, but mostly a sea of cliche's horrible dialog and stunning predictability.

It was like watching a 2 hour episode of 90210, complete with all the teen angst, rebellion, bullying and fighting and bro's you can handle. I think they used the word Bro at least 1000 times. How do a bunch of teens who have never been to earth, and barely even seen another human, speak in strings of North American slang.

This painful teen romp was followed an hour of save the whales, planet, natives, religion, culture (insert cause here) propaganda.

How do they have several billions worth of equipment specifically designed for ocean use, when they are based in a forest, and didn't even know Sully was hiding out with the water people till half way through the movie?

I was also wondering what was the point of adding Tarzan boy to movie, but then I realized at end. Can you say Avatar 3?

I rate this a 4 for being a well polished turd.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"3 hours of (admittedly quite cool) special effects scenes strung together with almost no storyline at all.

It's all such a cliché - bad guy is sent to kill good guy; good guy refuses to fight and goes into hiding; bad guy finds good guy and threatens his family; good guy fights bad guy and kills him; except the bad guy survives; cue sequel

So many pointless scenes that do nothing to advance or enhance the story. Pseudo whale hunts go on and on - we get it, the bad guys kill the friends of the good guys. Endless scenes of characters swimming around admiring strange creatures.

The dialogue is appalling - all ""bro!"" and ""Go, go, go!"".

The first Avatar was unusual with good SFX. This one seems just like a collection of those SFX scenes they couldnt fit into the first movie, but that cost too much to throw away.

I won't be watching Avatar 3, that's for sure.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"The new 'Avatar' movie is a rollercoaster of non-stop action and extraordinary visual effects, showcasing the pinnacle of current CGI capabilities. While it excels in delivering an adrenaline-fueled spectacle from start to finish, the film falls short in narrative depth. It prioritizes stunning visuals over a compelling storyline, which may leave fans of more story-driven cinema, like 'The Godfather', underwhelmed. Despite this, the movie is a perfect test for high-end audio equipment. The sound design is impeccable, particularly through Atmos sound bar speakers, where every audio detail comes to life, enveloping the viewer in the midst of the action. It's a feast for the senses, though perhaps not for the mind.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"The Bad= To start us off I feel that they took much time explaining that Jake is now family man, which I'm fine with but wow they feel like they took forever just to say that he is a family man and the Leader of the Forest Tribe. Not Only that in like in the first film why no who is he narrating to? At least in the first film he was making a Video Mission Report for the military but in this film he doesn't have that benefit, so I ask again Who is he talking to Narrating to?

Then after that I just couldn't find any character to be like able for me to personally to get behind. They could all get Nuked and I still wouldn't sadly care, I feel a big part of that is not only I found that mid way through it just started to feel like a Pandora High as in Pandora High School. Not Only you have these Navi Bullies trying to be Arrogant Mucho Idiot Jerks to keep it clean for IMDB whom where making, unwanted Sexual Advances Towards Jake Sully's Daughter. Which in turn forces his oldest son to come to her rescue. Which in turn cases them to bully him and making fun of him having a Small Tail, a Small Tail being stand in for something else, assuming you know what that other thing is? That's like something that you would see in a movie that takes place on earth and not a Sci Fi Movie that takes place on an Alien Planet.

And it wasn't isolated to that just one scene either as it happened at least one last time as I wasn't interested and or invested enough Past just past the mid way mark. And speaking of those bullies aren't the only elements of its kind, also on serval moments through out the film I also caught that very same Navi. Jake's daughter acting like a stereotypical Anime High School Girl with a secret High School crush, by Blushing like a Anime Girl from time to time like Human High School Girls do. In a bad. They even have the typical the bullies target forgiving the bullies when the said bullies are about to be punished, especially with the lead bully. It all feels like a bad movie or show that's about high school teenagers going to. That's not all the Navi's even use the word 'Bro' so much that it feels like they are from the 90's where the stereotypical teenaged high school boys talk like Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles. You know they things like ""Bro that is so wacked out bro."" or ""Dude that's so dop."" Or even ""Dude you got so punked bro you so got punked"" just for a few examples. And on top of all of that Jake Sully's kids never do what they ae told, their the type that think that they are special just because their father Jake Sully was made the leader of the Forest Tribe.

Speaking of the mid way mark it was so boring I not only shout if off and moved on to the next thing that I still needed to watch. But also I felt that they had some sort of action or find some other way of to push the story along anything I feel it probably would be just enough for me to stick around, maybe until the end of the film. Because although I thought it was fine and dandy that they decided to show the Forest Tribe Adapting to the Water Tribe and their environment, but I just feel like that portion of the film just went on way too long and this was Mid way through the film mind you. It would be like as if having Ripley in the Second Aliens film go on and on and on about her not wanting to go back to LV-426. Or it be like Morpheus taking up a good thirty or forty minutes of the first Matrix Film explaining to both us the Audience and Neo about what the Matrix is or whatever.

I also feel that a lot elements in this movie where retreaded from the first we have humans invading Pandora. With the inhabitants the Navi being forced to defend themselves and their planet. Why couldn't they have tried something deferent such as having the humans and the Navi being forced to team up with each other against a much bigger threat? Or have the military humans fight against the Navi sympathizers and the Navi? Or have the humans going to Pandora to try to help them develop their cutler but Quaritch and a bunch of his Troops that died isn't having it, out of Rage and Revenge? I have a problem with that too, but back to the matter at hand possibilities are literally almost endless. Anyways that is just one example of the retreads that they had, the rest sadly I couldn't remember to be honest.

Moving on nothing in this film makes any sense I've already mentioned the Navi Bullies, but also why? No better question how does Doctor Grace have a daughter? Spoiler Alert when her character died in the first film? Not only that but also can humans in Navi Avatar Bodies get Pregnant from real Navis? So many questions so many questions, too much for me to even have answered. Another example I hope it was just me but Neytiri in this film started acting like a jealous wife, when one of the other Navi's comes on to her husband Jake like she was a Home Wrecker? And that brings me to my next point why? Why was that Water Navi coming on to him when the Navi's from the Forest Tribe Arrive at the Water Tribe? And not only that but also that other Novi is not only Married herself but also is Carrying her husband's child in side her?

Other things just doesn't make sense to me Personally, the next is why? Why is not only Quaritch and a bunch of his soldiers coming back in the form of Navis? But also Spider is his kid? Then there is the fact that Jake is still Narrating why? Why is he Narrating in this film? At least in the first film it makes sense as he is Video Recording his Reports to the military, but in this film he doesn't have that luxury. Then the last example that I'm going to give is, why or how is Grace back but this time as a Vision or something? As she died in the first film as the Pandora World Tree or whatever they call it wasn't able to save her as I recall it? And that leads me to why? And what's the point of having her daughter who was also played Sigourney Weaver, I have a problem with that too. All of a suddenly have a Seizure after getting a Vision of her mother Doctor Grace, I just don't see a point to that maybe I just quit too early? But as is as I have said no point. Just to name a few examples.

I might have already alluded this before but I also Personally found that the film was so soulless which was why I had to quit, all because I did not cared about any of the characters. But aside from that I found myself asking ""What the is going on? I don't know I don't care I really don't"" which leads me to my next point. I think at least part of the reason why this movie is so soulless is because of lack of story, or at the very least a lack rememberable story. As it is literally a Copy And Paste of the first I have said, but let me expand on that a little. It is basically Human Soldiers invading Pandora but only this time there is no ryhm or reason why, aside from invading. At least in the first film there is a reason and that is to mine this rare metal element that only Pandora has. But in this film they don't seem to be after that Rare Metal Element any more, just good old revenge for the Quaritch character and his soldiers. On top of all of that I also feel that the Story was so Predictable, and not just Predictable but also it got the point where I was just taking wild guesses with me guessing half of them right just to take the boredom out of it.

This was also one of those movies where I was constantly checking the Runtime of the film and rolling my eyes back, when I find out that I'm only about half way through. It is as if in every single Terminator Film after the first Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 Terminator always comings back as the Villian Terminator and go after Sarah Connor. With Kyle Reese always having been sent back in time to Protect her. Or even what if they made a True Lies 2 and True Lies 2 is basically the same as the first but only with that daughter instead of the mother. Where she longs to be a spy and some where some time some how she encounters this con artist who clams to be a real spy. But in reality he just wants to get in to her pants, and then some thing else happens that allows her to become a real spy, perhaps through the means of a National Terrorist Plot to Blow Up the world? And I could on like this but don't worry I won't.

As I have said I did not finish it but from what I have read both the Big Climatic Battle and the Ending was, dull and pointless as literally nothing happens. After 13 years since the first film I was really hoping that there was at least something mind blowing about this film. Because it wasn't the visuals as the visuals was exactually like the first film, slightly worse in fact as this time around the visuals just doesn't feel all that impressive to me. Where as I felt the visuals for the first one was really cool and amazing as I feel that it was the perfect film to show off your New HD 3D or whatever TV, not so much with this one.

What happened to James Camron, now don't get me wrong I like James Camron as he is my favorite director or at least one of them? So much so four of his films are pretty high on my favorite's movies list. It's just his recent projects hasn't been his best to say the least, first there is his Terminator Dark Fate which was the Only Terminator Film that I did not like so much that I couldn't even get past the first act, and now this steaming pile of garbage. I really feel like there is no reason to go back to it as even saying something nice about the cover art feels like a hug stretch. As I feel that the cover art was not all that impressive but I do admit though I do like the water and sky scenery on it. And did I mentioned that this film was also so Confusing at times? Yeah it is. And that pretty much do it for the Negatives for now unless I'm forgetting something else.

The Good= Speaking of the only True Positives that I could give this film is that one I do appreciate their efforts of not only trying but obviously failed to some how progress the.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I have no idea how this movie has 8 stars! You know when a film feels like 8 hours long it's bad and it was indeed a very long and depressing 3 hours. I love fantasy but the story and the way it's told is so poor.

I'm not sure about anyone else but I go to the cinema for fun and enjoyment and this whole film is brutal cruelty and injustice without much happiness to make it worthwhile.

What is a shame is they have created the amazing world and amazing special effects but then it becomes self indulgent with long spells of underwater scenes that drag.

Trying to think of some positives, but I just found the whole experience painful and a disappointment. In hindsight I would have paid double my ticket price not to see it and waste an evening!

Avatar: The Way of Water,"Okay, let's get something straight from the beginning. Yes, the visuals are amazing, I get that. But this is not some Unreal Engine promo.

I never expected nor wished for an outstanding plot. I say with all honesty that I went to the cinema without any expectation for plot at all. And yet, no matter how much good will I armed myself with, nothing could prepare me for the horrendousness I've just witnessed.

There is absolutely nothing coherent in this movie whatsoever. There's too many characters, too many plotlines, too much stuff going on. There's too many moment that require massive narration to explain the backstories. It's just too much to handle, and nothing goes any direction. There is never a purpose, never.

The characters are, for the most part, unlikeable. I could not bond/empathize with a single one of them.

I should add that I am really not a big fan of film plots where all characters always make bad decisions, without exception and also without any learning outcome. The character development in this film is absolutely missing. Gone.

I don't think I've ever felt so much disappointment about a film ever in my life. I am deeply disgusted.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"So, Cameron took 13 years to come up *this*?!

It's basically a water-logged version of the first one. If I had to guess, he spent 6 months on this and hoofed around for 12-1/2 years.

The cast is good, overall. But, there are some nagging plot holes, which I won't list here. There is some wooden acting, some pointless dialogue and an overly long run time. The CG looks a little cartoonish at times, but overall, Pandora looks beautiful - but that's not enough to make a movie.

One final complaint: the green water Na'vi are kind of ugly. I would have thought Cameron would have made them more attractive.

Very disappointed with this one. I'm just glad that I didn't waste money at the theater on this dud. As is, I'm not happy about losing 3 hours of my life on this.",2

Basically make new stuff not sequels to films that don't need it. Disappointed in James for even doing these and not spawning something newer.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"JC is making a mockery of us all by simply regurgitating past successes wrapped in beautiful bows of CGI and 'motion capture' FX.

1. The graphics were on point, in 2009. Sad to say there was really no noticeable difference 13 years later. James needs to realize what got him here, won't get him 'there'.

2. This sequel figuratively 'craps' on the entirety of the motivations that made the audience care about Pandora and everything that made the first one special. (e.g., what about unobtanium, where's the grand unity; the spirituality, why are these once great protagonists now so one dimensional?)

3. Completely unoriginal plot accompanied by a lackluster story, to say the least. No depth, no continuation of the moral principles, James just does a fantastic job at insulting the audience by simply copy-pasting climactic elements from past franchises. It's evident the only goal here was to separate money from wallets when after more than a decade of development, we get the same tired old antagonist, altercations and plot vehicles. JC should be absolutely crippled with shame after pumping this the way he has.

4. The acting was uninteresting, boring and in many scenes tedious; yes, I'm looking at you Zoe and Sam. Perhaps just a result of their characters radical change for absolutely no gain.

5. Character continuity is obviously not as important to this franchise as hectic world building. It's a shame these actors were on-board with such a dismantling of their original characters. Is the audience really to believe that self-righteous American family values just all the sudden trump generations of indigenous culture? Neytiri is reduced to an emotional basket-case of a housewife/mother, with at least half of her script being wailing in anguish or screaming in anger. Jake's character instead doubles down on the dumb jarhead persona who's only goal now is to keep his family together and safe, like a good little pack of marines, yet stumbles miserably at that. Quaritch is just a steaming pile of disappointment, I can't describe how lazy and dissatisfying it is to see them base the continuation of the franchise on this shallow, unrelatable ogre. Kiri/Grace could have had such potential, but instead the audience gets lackadaisical religious doctrine with little to no explanation nor acknowledgement by any of the other characters.

6. Character development is on par with the Hallmark channel. Now that Jake and Neytiri have been reduced to mindless nuclear parents, we get uninteresting kids who do nothing but the opposite of what they know to be right, simply for the sake of introducing dramatic affect to move the story along to the next unoriginal conflict. Entirely new populations of characters now some-how know a great deal of the English language. Their youth seems eerily in-tune with twenty-first century teen culture and similarly are inherently disrespectful, rude and demeaning for no other reason than to create cheap conflict resolution.

7. The new 'McGuffin' is pitiful and insignificant to the franchise and so forgettable that it's abandoned almost as fast as it's explained. The 'sky people' are back, but is it to terraform or is it for the elixir of life? Who knows and who cares, because no matter the reasoning the message here is clearly the same --humanity shaming.

8. The erratic filming frame rates also make this visually exhausting (seen in IMAX 3D). This movie was filmed in 48 fps, as well as in 24 fps and is nowhere near consistent. Every other shot is rapidly switching back and forth, so one scene will be established in 24 fps, then suddenly switch to 48 fps, and it happens throughout the entire movie. I was literally crying in the theatre, but certainly not due to the utterly superficial story.

Rating: 2/10 stars: Just bad movie making.

Entertaining --yet neutered-- computer aided visuals carried this 3+ hour storyline/screenplay like a donkey through the wetlands. This film was made for the dull and unimaginative.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Don't waste your money !! The story is written by a 5 year old and the special effects are overhyped. The so called world building is nothing to speak of. The characters are uni-dimensional and not engaging at all. The writers don't give us any reason to care for the Sully family. The audience never gets drawn into their struggles because they are BORING ! One can only watch alien creatures frolicking in the ocean for so long.

The sequel just proves James Cameron is all about the gloss, no substance. The movie would have been far more interesting if it revolved around the character of Grace's daughter. We would be more intrigued to know who her father was, what made her different and how the Sully family went out of their way to protect her with their sacrifices and toils.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Could it be worse? Nothing has been added in 10 years as far as the graphics. The plot was stolen for a B western move from the 1930s. The acting is awful. Maybe there's an excuse for such poor acting given the make-up, but its' horrible nonetheless. The so-called high tech is not very advanced for a film that takes place decades in the future. They stuff up a machine gun and think that passes for future weapons. They put a kid in a merry-go-around and think that is futuristic interrogation,. What a joke! OK I walked out after an hours, so maybe something happens in the last 2 hours to make it all worthwhile. Meantime I have a bridge in Brooklyn I can sell to you.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"It is hard to believe that makers of such a magnificient movie as Avatar come out with a sequel which is such a drab and a disaster.

Unlike the first one, which contains amazing unravelling of an innovative concept and the unfolding of the story to go with, Avatar 2 contains nothing new. The theme is simply the lineage of the original villain trying to take revenge on the hero and the hero fighting it out and suffers some losses in the process. Theme for a very ordinary Masala movie with nothing innovative.

The last 45 minutes is a torture to watch as they have dragged it on and on and on and on. The hero's side keep killing the villains who are about dozen and odd, but the villain's side people keep surfacing again and again to attack hero's side. There is no sense for numbers and the story simply doesn't progress in the last 45 minutes with meaningless fights repeated on and on.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"That's 3 hours plus I won't get back ...hopefully there's not a directors cut on its way. Whilst the visuals were on another planet so to speak, I wondered in no particular order - where was Jack and Rose? , 'why so serious?' How can someone in a stranglehold asphyxiate under water ? And was this a bloated and dull version of 'Free Willy' set on Pandora? A talking whale asking 'how was the baby?' Was another popcorn choking moment. After the first groundbreaking Avatar and following 13 years of thought and development, the result was disappointing, surely a story first not a series of predictable links.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Though Jake Sully's children enjoy spotlight in the movie, the script shows them getting captured repeatedly by violent killers and being thrown in life threatening situations. My 9 yr old was distressed through the movie. The obsession to keep Sully's character alive for further sequels sees a violent death of one of his children, life threatening violence against another child. C'mon a family movie depicting something this gruesome! In the end it was a sigh of relief that it was over. Guns and knives pointed at children or being used by children/on children is not the idea of a family movie IMHO.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"The first Avatar was poetic and sent a message full of hope. This totally lacks storytelling, there is absolutely no surprise or inspiration in the script.

Boomer macho style (men protect their family) wrapped up in a 3 hour long gun fight (did no one tell Cameron that more guns fuels more violence?).

Thankfully the graphics are fantastic and beautiful, but to what end? What message is Cameron sending to viewers about society and its values? Is having your son killed what protecting your family means? And why play the Titanic ploy again with the sinking ship?

Frankly, it seems everyone were too busy producing the graphics to think about the script.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"The alien things are all good because they are eco friendly and somewhat cultured. The humans are all evil because they use fossil fuels etc. Stunningly boring and every scene is predictable. The alien things will win all the time every time, the humans are useless. What's the point? You know the ending before the film even starts. And what was that character Spider? What was his purpose? Didn't he speak as though he was from california even though he has never been to earth? This is not as bad as Disney star wars as the new ""empire"" was completely useless. That's why this review gets a 2. It's Christmas and at least the main character was a strong male lead.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"This was the longest three hours I ever spent in a cinema where nothing conclusive or concrete happens in a movie. It's just loads of great CGI etc but where the effects triumphed, the story lacked. This movie could have been condensed to 1 hour and they could have given us a final ending in the next 2 hours.

Instead they chose the drag out everything so long, that I feel asleep a couple of times during the movie and each time I woke up, the story had not developed and I had missed nothing.

If you need an excuse to be absent from somewhere for 3 hours or you want to sleep, then go watch it, otherwise just go to Wikipedia to read the summary and wait for the next part as this one was left on an unsatisfying cliffhanger. Too much time was spent between this part and the first part, at least the first part had a great story. This was just a cash grab so they can now start production on a third part.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"My goodness... this was a truly painful experience. I want my 3+ hours back. A rehash of the original movie which was just an old story rehashed with graphics and effects. Please stop at ""2"" and stop listening to ""yes men/women"" who keep encouraging you to take old and tired plot lines and add graphics then say ""this is the new future of movie making ""... yuck...! James Cameron... please get your head out of the tired old tropes and stop believing what your inner circle is saying. Kicking indigenous people off their land for something you want ain't much of a plot line. To make two movies about it and then adding the lion and the mouse fable to it is insulting to the mouse. Time to walk away from this while you still can and start thinking outside the box.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"What is enjoyable: 1. The underwater concepts were fun and magical. I loved the whale-like creatures. I wish they would have slowed things down even more.

2. The concept of a blended family.

What is not enjoyable: 1. Basically the storyline and the character development is really weak. Nothing surprising or that beautiful to pull at the heart. Pretty images can only do so much for a film.

2. The amount of violence. I thought this would be more about living in harmony with a new people and land but they're still fighting the humans.

3. Number of times I heard bro and curse words and the American accents of the family members. Really takes away the fantasy aspect and cheapens the script.

4. They used Papyrus font. Are you kidding me? Must not have seen the SNL skit with Ryan Gosling.

I would not consider this for family movie night even though the story centers itself around family.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I know a lot of people loved, loved, loved Avatar, but I was very much not one of them. There was no doubt it looked impressive, but I found it an overly long version of a story that I just didn't care for - so it's safe to say I'm not exactly looking forward to this.

Dear God, there's 3:12 of the thing. ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO MINUTES! Who needs that?!? If I had just one guess, I suspect I'd go for ""not me"".

Well, I did it! ALL the way through and boy was it a struggled. There's no doubt that a lot of the components of the film are impressive and I promise I'll try to remember to mention some of them. But...

...there's a very fine line between ""epic"" and ""dull"" and this film sees that line, speeds over it and leaves it for dust in the rear view mirror. It also desperately wants me to care about the characters - and I just don't. I don't know if it's because they're animated or because they are aliens or because they're not particularly well written - but I really don't care if all of them and their beautiful planet gets entirely destroyed. In fact, I'd destroy it myself if it meant the film finished in half the time.

Actually, I'm not being entirely fair there - if it was half the time, then I might have cared an awful lot more about it all. There is a decent enough (but not great or particularly original) story hiding in there and there were some moments in the last hour where I did feel slightly engaged - but even they were spoiled because...

...there are too many setpieces which are only there to provide a visual spectacle but they add nothing to the plot - they would be impressive (although still too long) if part of a David Attenborough documentary, but all you've got here is the imagination and ability of the animators. There is, however, no doubt that they are very able animators (IMDB lists 63 of them!) - there's some very impressive visuals on display in pretty much every frame of the film. I found the ""animated"" humans particularly intriguing - they manage to somehow look real and fake at the same time.

My other major talking point is that for a film with such a stellar cast, a lot of the voice acting isn't great - it's all very over the top. The baddies in particular are all very pantomime villain and some of the other characters have very poorly written motivations, so I guess the cast were just working with what they'd been given but, once again, it didn't help me care about things.

Wikipedia tells me this film has grossed over $2 billion worldwide, which is an absolutely mad amount of money. And, joy of joys, that means we're going to get Avatar 3, 4 and 5!! Wikipedia also explains why it didn't appear in The Guardian's list with their critic having described it as having a ""scathingly bland plot"" - I agree with the sentiment, although I remain unsure about the use of the word ""scathingly"" there!

You know what (and this might surprise you) I really didn't like this film (although I did enjoy picking that quote as the post title) and I am completely mystified by its popularity. If you want to watch it you can find it in all the usual places, but I struggle to imagine why anyone would want to do that to themselves.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Tired old left wing Hollywood making bash America movies. Americans are bad they steal whale oil, kill and hunt animals, steal resources and land, yada yada. It was Pocahontas with blue people. Or Dances with Wolves under the ocean. Nobody mourned the dead American soldiers floating dead in the ship, they were just following orders. Never mind that Jake was a traitor for going over to the other side and fighting against his own people, killing his own people. Never mind that the sophisticated weapons the Navi were using could never have been invented and made by the peaceful but underdeveloped Navi society, but were clearly stolen. Yes, I get that Quaritch was overly vengeful but this movie was so terribly one sided and they made him that way to encourage sympathy with the Navi. England took the land from the Native American Indians. Since America was formed, we haven't taken anyone's land, indeed we have fought and bled to help them keep theirs. Why all the America bashing? What happened in Hollywood in the last 50 years? Nobody can make a pro-American or an original movie?",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"This is not a movie, Its a documentary on Discovery channel.

Just came back from watching this long awaited movie and felt like I wasted 3 hours of my New year. There is no story in this movie, Its just a prolonged documentary where you see good VFX and animation.

As suggested by others, this is not 2009, Avatar-1 had a great story to it apart from its animation. It showed the bonding of Navi people with nature.

If the Director wants to live up to its reputation then he has to bring in more strength to the script. It like there was nothing else to show therefore the Director made the kids do the misadventures again and again. It was cynical when the little Navi ""Tuk"" said that I cant believe I am caught again on the boat. I too felt like ""What Not again"".

The only reason why I gave it 2 star is because I hope its a prequel to something good brewing up.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Be warned that this movie is not for families and children! Children are targeted with guns, a bleeding wound is cut on the child's neck with a knife, and one of the children dies. Now that said, we can move on to my review.

I really liked these James Cameron movies: The Terminator, Aliens, Titanic and of course Avatar. But Avatar: The Way of Water feels like it's not a James Cameron movie.

The length of the movie in my country is 3 hours and 28 minutes including commercials, which is absolutely insane. The length of the film itself is about 3 hours, which is clearly too much. 2 hours would be more appropriate, because the viewer would lose nothing. The story develops very slowly, and many questions are left in the air that are never answered.

The story is almost the same as in the first movie - bad people come to fight with the locals. But in this movie, Jake Sully has a family. These family members are acting very strangely and keep repeating the same things.

I noticed that a lot of materials from the first movie have been used, both in terms of sound and scenes. This is not a very good decision in my opinion because I have already heard and seen it.

The big bad antagonist is Colonel Miles Quaritch, you guessed it, the same character from the first movie. I didn't expect this and it's just awful. This same character learns exactly where Jake Sully is based on one of the roque helicopters. How is that possible? Anyone can have a fun ride with it.

Avatar: The Way of Water introduces only one important underwater species and that is the large whale. And that's it!

The last battle is also where they go with the water tribe to save Jake Sully's children and at one point the whole tribe is gone (evaporated into thin air), and Jake has to fight alone alongside his family. Of course, the whale comes to the rescue, but that's practically all because Eywa (the All-Mother/Great Mother) does not help this time.

Summary: Save money and don't waste your time!",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"How this endeavor has garnered positive attention just smacks as to the engine of the masses being asses. This thing bloats its way via very predictable narrative to inevitable non-conclusion. And for what?

The paper thin story dressed up in all its CGI remains that same paper thin rambler. No amount of window dressing can foster interest in any of these unremarkable characters. You. Will. Yawn. A lot.

Cameron's heydays have come and sadly gone, so why the emperor's new clothes treatment here? No idea. And there's more sequels in the pipeline? Why!? Save your precious time, and avoid this sequel.

Production value is aces. Everything else? Hard pass, hence the deuce.",2
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I remember really enjoying the first movie including the storyline. Visuals were stunning of course, but so are Christopher Nolan's movies which he tries to shoot real scenes and use very little CGI.

This sequel was dull and boring. Very repetitive scenes and some terrible dialog. I was seriously bored after about 1 1/2 hours and ready for it to just be over. Almost felt like I was watching a Pixar film.

I ended up leaving tired, disappointed and with a stomach ache from eating way too much popcorn to entertain myself.

Easily could have napped and woke up just for the end. I don't see the hype.. and can't imagine him making 3 more of these!",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Summary -> Incredibly stupid story. Many inconsistencies. Great effects. Disappointing.

Went to watch the movie because of the first Avatar. Don't know what I was expecting, but for sure not to be bored after 20 min.

The story is typical American ""Vietnam"" action movie..There is no elegance. No flow. The worst is the cliff hung at the end - leaving a possibility for another boring expensive mish - mash.

On the other hand the effects are gorgeous. Strongly reminded me the ""Life of Pi"" (2012). Probably the wish to keep as much as possible of them made the movie so long.

No clear message from the movie. First you play chicken and when somebody rape your daughter / kill your son you go berserk? ""The man has to protect his family"" ? What a cliché !

Give it 5 stars from the greatness of my heart only for the effects. Terrible disappointment.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"After years of waiting, the very first scene gave me what I've been wanting for so long. Truly the only real reason I actually wanted to see this thanks to the trailers, I had no Idea that it would be proudly presented after years of a cliffhanger. I grown since the first avatar and let me tell you there is nothing more satisfying than what I saw when our favorite blue people came back to the cinema screen, what powerful gifts bestowed upon us for our most humble patience over the years. Yes, this glorious moment shall be the seed of hundreds of new fans to go swarm the dark corners of the web, to sing of these new feelings.

Ladies and gentleman, What I have gained from watching this film is...

A pregnancy fetish.

I shall not explain no more than what I have nor will I actually review the film, go now my children and see to it that you gain it as well, good day, until the next mid Avatar sequel.

Avatar: The Way of Water,"Basically the title. It is rather boring movie when you look past fancy visual effects. Story is nothing new, you already watch this movie from story side. A lot of story elements are really easy to predict. A lot of people are saying that it is action packed but it is not for how long movie is. VFX are Meeeh for me, i already seen in other movies so i wasn't really impressed. I am going to watch first Jurassic Park again, that has more impressive VFX for its time. At the end it is just a VFX demo reel that is fully featured length of a movie with a copied story from previous Avatar (or cartoon) movie.",3

And seriously why?

They're hunting your family only. So yhe decision to flee and jeopardize a whole community?

Then something will happen to make the water people like them and they'll train them and there will be the one hold out who eventually comes around and is like you're one of us now or some nonsense.

It was really primitive and cheap movie. I had high hopes about this movie, but it was really really disappointing. I actually feel bad watching it was really bad.

Avatar: The Way of Water,"This is what took 13 years to make? Seriously? Who directed this like a videogame and overly sped-up action scenes-horny teenager and where have they buried the real James Cameron? I will definitely not go back to the theater for any more Avatar movies after this fiasco, I will wait for them to stream or not watch them at all. I didn't even feel the 3D as much this time either, it was a fairly flat movie with a few moments of 3D when projectiles were flying at me or particles floating in front of the image. No more proper pacing, no more slowing down some scenes to create actual awe and wonder, everything is fast-paced like it's made by a complete maniac. What a let-down, wow. It's not even a ""visual spectacle"" this time because all the plants and animals look like plastic figurines in a videogame's cutscenes (which is only made even more obvious and jarring if you see it in HFR), so it failed even at its most basic task. And as many have said, the writing is also bottom of the barrel stuff, again like the ""script"" for your average videogame between-missions cinematics. Considering this and the Dark Fate fiasco I'm starting to believe James Cameron is actually dead and has been replaced by a lookalike just to keep the marketing going.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I'd like to congratulate all the CGI folk worked on this movie for their patience, because it is not a good movie.

I hated ""bro"", ""sup"", ""cuz"" and all the cursing even though I curse a lot in a day. I get it, they wanted to include the youth in the movie but their acting training was terrible. They are still kids, not actors, no good actor acts that way, talks that way.

I also hated the duration. It is long, way too long for the current state of the world. Who has more than 3 hours to waste on a story? I do not.

I also despised all the underwater glob glob glob sound when they were diving. They could have cut that scene from 5 minutes to literally 5 seconds.

As said, it is a very very very tiring movie at best 3/10.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Avatar The Way of Water is basically the same as the first installment but with more characters that unfortunately aren't fleshed out well enough for you to care for them. The storyline of this second version of Avatar was basically almost exactly the same as the first movie 13 years ago. It even seemed that it didn't know which direction it wanted to go and just mashed up different events and ideas randomly together into a 3 hour movie, which eventually left you with an unsatisfying feeling. The 3D effect is however yet again top notch, you feel as if the characters were real and alive on screen, however I am afraid that the 3D gimmick has worn out over time, that 3D alone wont contribute significantly enough anymore to make a film watchable.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Was looking forward to this movie. Amazing visuals but weak story and excessive violence throughout for over three hours. Basically a battle movie of high-resolution video game characters in a Myst-like CG environment. And, definitely not a pro-environmental movie. The movie makers seemed to celebrate rather than condone the violence in the whale hunt scene. Zoe Saldana's character was the best part of Avatar 1, but was unfortunately given too little to do here. Finally, the editing was jarring, which is surprising given there were four editors credited including Jim Cameron. Not looking forward to Avatar 3... or 4... or 5.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"So Avatar 2 turns out to be everything I expected it to be and not even a picogram more: technically impressive images (the detail of the human expressions on the alien faces really stand out) and a few very well-staged action scenes, all situated within a soul-numbingly dragged-out, tedious and instantly forgettable story, with no surprises of any kind at any point. I liked the stable and loving nuclear family aspect of it, but what is so out of step with the ""progressive"" agenda today would have been commonplace 25 years ago - which is when, to be honest, it feels like the script was written, too.

The simplest and most accurate summation is just that it's the most expensive and highly detailed cartoon ever made, but once you know that, you really have no further reason to even see the film at all, and, just like the first Avatar, this is a movie that I already know for certain I will never watch again.

4½ out of 10.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I'm going to start of saying that this movie is a milestone in visual graphics, it is stunning and beautiful as well as impressive. The VFX team and the animators deserve everything coming from this point on.

That is where it ends though. Cameron really wanted this movie to be 180+ minutes. The entire story could have been told in 120. It's obvious there's an extra hour or so of scenes just there to show the pretty visuals. The story is outdrawn and there are scenes that could have been completely left out and be told by short clips. The slaughter of all the animals is one of those scenes and a scene I'd rather not have seen.

Then there's the whole accent going on among the Sully kids, it's ""bro"" this and ""bro"" that, in almost every sentence to a point where it becomes outright annoying to listen to their conversations and lose all interest in the characters, their story and what happens to them.

Same goes with Neytiri and her screams and breaths, it sounds like she's had a cold that she never recovered from. I understand that's how the actress sound, but they could have fixed it somehow.

Visually stunning with a story and characters that are easily forgotten. I walked out of the cinema not really caring when the next movie will be released.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I really hope this is the last 'Avatar' film I ever see. They are not for me. They are designed for people who are under the influence and just want some fun visuals to look at. There's no substance, hell there's barely even a plot. And they still find a way to stretch it well past 3 hours.

The best movie villains are relatable. You don't have to be on their side, but you have to understand where they are coming from. This movie doesn't have that. The villain's motives are as forced as I've ever seen in a film. And it's exactly the same as the first movie.

The movie may look good, if you care about that, but I will never understand the concept of everyone looking exactly the same. It's exhausting having to look for small details in every single scene just to work out who is actually talking.

This one is long, tedious, lacking in any kind of a story and immediately forgettable. They even found a way to make Jemaine Clement boring. I must've looked at my watch a hundred times during this movie and I swear at one point time had actually gone backwards. A very generous 3/10.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"This movie keeps getting prolonged because these creatures keep putting themselves in danger... like every few minutes. After being put in danger, the next few minutes shows them putting themselves right back into more danger. WTF?!?!! That's what I kept noticing and then getting annoyed about this movie.

Not only that, but the protagonist that supposedly is all big and bad is actually weak and a chump! He had so many chances to get Jake Sully, but he chickened out.

I gave this movie some stars because of the details and clarity that made the movie look good, but the story is just bad. They're just trying to make multiple series of this movie, and I get how they needed to make something for part 2, but the time it took to finally make one after all these years and then have it turn out like this was bad on the writers.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"+ I only give it a 3/10 for it's fantastic look.

If you care about logic in a film like me then you will absolutely hate this movie. In the end of the movie they acually made it a final boss fight between only the protagonists and antagonists completely ignoring that there were about 300 random Avatar soldiers at the beginning of the fight and after the fight again. Also I think you saw hundreds of technological advanced humans die while you only saw one tribesman avatar die.


The plot armor is extreme. Even for the main antagonist.


Only one protagonist had no plot armor in the end which was obviously only to make people sad about his death. I couldn't have cared less tough.


The movie is 100% black and white like in a disney movie to make sure you know who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.


The movie shoves down your throat the importance of family. It is so overused it is actually way worse than in Fast & Furious. Family!!!


A lot of unimportant scenes which contribute nothing to the story.


It is way too long. Even for people who liked the movie.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Look. I accepted the first movie as a Dances with Wolves remake, because the CGI was out of this world, and to be honest many Sci Fi movies are just retelling of other stories, but in space.

But this extremely long sequel was just a rehash of the plot of the first movie minus jungle, and insert ocean. For a move spanning hours it had the following plot twists... Baddies return, Goodies escape, Goodies adjust to aquatic environment, Baddies search and find Goodies, Final confrontation and Goodies win with the help of mother nature.

The rest is just full of anti-colonialism and environmental conservation tropes.

Look. I'm up for a movie that challenges unbridled or corrupt development and environmental destruction, but it's the 21st century - can't we do it with a bit more subtlety than this?

So on top of the boring plot line (see above) the rest is filled with the natives communing with Mother Gaia or so many white colonisers are bad tropes... anti-mining, anti-military, anti-whaling, anti-Vietnam (US Marines terrorising natives and burning villagers), anti-manifest destiny, anti-exploitation of the environment. Again, I am not saying these are not noble themes to pursue (as they were in the first film), but this film just becomes preachy to the extreme. No subtlety, no counterpoint (e.g. The scientists in the first film).

So I didn't give this a 1 because, yes the underwater CGI and flying fish dinosaurs were quite cool, and coz Sam Worthington, Brendan Cowell and Germaine Clement are legends.

The best part, really the only good part is the effects. As numerous people mentioned, it is like watching Planet Earth. Maybe James Cameron should just make a faux-documentary of this planet instead of trying to tell a story.

Aside from the effects though this move is tough to stomach. There are just so many plot holes. To begin they bring back the marines from the first movie, as Avatars, and these characters even discuss how the mixture of their marine training combined with their new enhanced physical abilities will make them formidable. Instead though, they are beaten over and over again by everyone from Jake Sully to his wife to small children. For marines they seem to have no tactical awareness at all. I mean literally Zoe Saldana's character shoots arrow after arrow through the unsuspecting cockpits of the gunships. At some point you would think they would reinforce the glass or not have glass at all. Along that same line, for all their technological advancements, the humans seem incapable of having any ships or soldiers that can look up or behind them where, you know, they are repeatedly attacked. They also seem to lack any sort of sonar capacity when fighting the whales.

Speaking of the whales, apparently they are super geniuses with not just their own language but also philosophy and mathematics. One whale is killed in the whole movie and we the audience are supposed to be sad, meanwhile hundreds of people are brutally murdered and no one seems to care, literally a wire chops a man's arm off but he deserved because he was trying to hunt whales...which I guess it terrible.

Also, while I understand the Navi's connection with the environment is important, it was painful when one of them started talking to a whale by...I guess looking at it? Also I am confused what animals are ok to hate/kill and which are fine, there are multiple scenes of the Navi fishing and then another where a shark-like animal is killed but that is fine. However killing any other animal seems abhorrent. Guess everyone is a vegetarian.

The logic behind so much of the movie is flawed too. As many others have mentioned, why would Jake leave his forest base to go hide when he knows, from the first movie, that it will not stop his enemies from hunting him. Instead of attacking this forest base though to lure him into a fight, those enemies, led by the avatar of the colonel from the first movie just...uh...skip over it for some reason and then go to villages where they burn some huts and shoot one sea creature. Then, during several showdowns the colonel captures Jake's kids and threatens to kill them...only to never actually harm them. Also why do the humans chase after Jake and his family with only a couple gunships and a boat designed for whale hunting versus their entire fleet as per the first movie, it just makes no sense. Even in the beginning when the Navi attack the train and steal the weapons, how could those weapons be useful when they are designed for humans who are much smaller than the Navi? How can the Navi even utilize them? Others have also mentioned even the rare mineral the humans want is changed from the first one, why? There are just so many parts that make no sense. Every time though, you begin to have questions the movie cuts to 20 minutes of stunning visuals to put you at ease again.

There is also a significant theme of family in the movie, not quite Fast and Furious levels but close. A lot of that theme is about accepting people (or I guess Navi) that are different than you and trying to fit in. At the same time though Jake's wife has an early and recognized prejudice against the one human living amongst the Navi and even tries to kill him at one point, despite him risking his life to help them. I just kept waiting for her to apologize, but the movie just glossed over it. Also the idea that these Navi creatures live in different tribes and even have different adaptations but never war with each other is so silly. Clearly they are based off of indigenous cultures and I am sorry to say this but sometimes those cultures fought EACH OTHER. In this movie though that is never the case and also no animals are never killed, except the mean ones. The scene where the shaman woman brings back one of the Navi children to life by blowing on her while the medical devices were totally ineffective was laughable too, don't worry about biology everyone I'll just blow on her back.

My biggest problem though is one that is common in so many of these big budget movies now, namely there are just no real stakes. You know the good guys are going to win and no one is ever going to get hurt. Ok, I know one of Jake's kids gets killed but then they have a scene that basically implies he is not really dead in that Jake and the family can plug their braids into a plant and see him any time. But that's just how it is now. There are more and more characters and if by chance one is killed they are immediately replaced by another new character and the deceased likely has a spin-off or some way of communicating and is then really not even dead. (In this case they adopt the human trying to help them...who Zoe Saladana tried to kill...must be awkward.) What makes a movie dramatic and compelling is risk, is stakes. If the good guys always win then what is the point, in effect the good guys almost become the detestable ones. This is the same thing that happened in all these new Star Wars movies/shows and in the endless super hero movies. You don't appreciate summer without winter, you don't appreciate sun without rain.

I know this has come off as a long, perhaps confused rant but there were just so many parts of this movie that were illogical that it was painful. It was three hours and could easily have been an hour and half. To save some space here then, the dialogue was also terrible, someone else mentioned the overuse of ""bro"", there description was accurate.

With all that being said though, you might as well go see the movie in theaters and in 3D. Go outside, go to a theater and have a good time with a movie that will awe you visually and not challenge you mentally.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"This film was utter tosh. Pretty to look at, but no story. Way too long as well.

The starts with a load of exposition dumps to try and set up some kind of story. We are no longer looking for Unobtainium, but something that make humans live longer and oh yeah Earth is dying some we want to move to their planet. There is a lot of pretty swimming underwater, a whale thing has a flash back, one of the blue people has Mother Earth super powers and the son is total screw up all the way through, without redemption. The action at the end is OK, but very forgettable.

This cost obscene amount of money to make. Please start with a good story then make it pretty.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Avatar is a highly disappointing film that fails to live up to its hype. Despite its ""impressive special effects"", the film is lacking in terms of plot and character development. The CGI creatures and settings are impressive, but they still do not look photo-realistic and the motion capture performances are not fully convincing. The entire three hour saga appears more like an endless intro to a computer game rather than a film. Extremely unrealistic in every respect. I never thought I would get to this point where I would write a negative review for a film from my favorite genre, but here I am, leaving a negative rating for a film for the first time in 23 years.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"This movie started good, nice story, building on the first story. Then the humans appeared. The movie went bad, more bad up until extremely bad. I quit watching after 2 hours. Maybe the director wants to send a message to us that we have to get rid of our selfishness, I don't know. In the first movie there also was this educational moment: ""This is how it's done. When people are sitting on stuff that you want, you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it"". In this part 2 it's the same, they will kill everything when it is in their benefit. The graphics were stunning, that's all very good but the story is very negative, it depressed me, so I quit watching. I don't want this extreme kind of drama movies any more. The world is already as bad as it can get.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"A complete waste of 3 hours if you've already seen the first one. Maintains the same story line and premise, same villain (inexplicably), same scenes and sequences, recycled dialogue and enhanced special effects.

I only kept watching to see if they would continue to rip off their own movie- which was already a rip off of pochahontas. It didn't disappoint in that aspect. Follows the same ebbs and flows, story structure, action scenes and ending. Just felt like a very updated copy and paste.

The only fun additions seem to be ripped from Jim Cameron's other smash hit- Titanic. There are exact sequences and scenes from that movie to. Thus cementing the fear behind there being an finite amount of words and action to tell original and new stories.

Cool graphics though Jim boy.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I have many questions! This was a humiliation. The story makes no sense at all. Its only a cash grab project with same villain but now on sea instead of jungle. Added teens with cringey US slangs like a bunch of youtubers talking ""bro I gotcha' "" constantly, very annoying.

Villain team wearing green military equipment, very unrealistic, chasing one guy for no reason. Banshees/drones sounding like helicopters, whales sounding like lions, Natives sound like cowboys ""weeehaaaaa"" on their rides. Come on...so many annoying things that the I just wanted to

Great CGI can't save movies anymore! The script is a total wreck, its like a teen youtuber directed this project. 3 hours of annoying clishé and low level dialogs and storyline.

Not even close to the first one! Just a bad copy of it from wish.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I admit I could not finish this. I made it about an hour but I had like two more hours to go and I could not torture myself any longer. I admit when I saw the first Avatar in theaters, I was mesmerized. When I watched it again later on DVD I was less impressed. It kind of sucked and didn't make a whole lot of sense. I avoided seeing The Way of Water because frankly I just don't care about this franchise at all, even though I think Cameron is a masterful director. But finally I decided to try and watch Avatar 2 and man, it is a stinker. I mean yeah the effects in these movies is great but really James, you were away for all those years and this is the best you could think of for a story? The same villain comes back? The humans are once again trying to invade? This is the EXACT same movie except even worse than the first one. Sadly it made a lot of money and there seem to be no limit to how many people think this movie is great so now we have to endure the sequels as well. It just saddens me so much that James Cameron has made some of the greatest movies of all time but will likely end his career on these dumpster fire Avatar movies.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"It's a bunch of hype. The first avatar was decent especially with the graphics. In comparison this one graphics were ok but it seems the same as 15 years ago .so I won't even say it was visually stunning or great just good for today, not the future. Now to the bad. The story sucks, its too long (3 hrs plus), it's annoying. Literally who wants to watch a bunch of unruly teens who have no real acting parts who are constantly YELLING with surround sound. Next The parents are stupid, dad being less stupid and annoying. Mom is a typical steroype of minority woman who does ahit all but YELL HYSTERICALLY. Horribly annoying for 3 hrs.",3
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Lots of plot holes, lots of ""telling"" instead of ""showing"" and it felt like they didn't really knew in which direction this movie should go.

The old characters don't even act like their characters. None of them has a single brain cell, except the whales. At one point it's just them being in a rebellion, then a family vacation/ travel movie, then a father son bounding movie, then a horse girl movie, then a Barbie movie, then titanic. Those are only a few examples.

The worst think of all is that there is no real end result. The main problem wasn't solved, probably so they can have a reason to make a third part. The only moral of this story is to use birth control or get a vasectomy.

But hey, it's pretty. I like how the coast people have a different anatomy then the forest people. The world building itself is so great. But the characters and the story itself makes it ""meh"".

Sry not sry for the bad English.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I had certain expectations coming into this movie. I did not expect a great story, as the first installment didn't exactly bring anything new to the table. What it did bring was revolutionary visual effects. Mind you, it was still ropey in parts, but it was undeniably beautiful. After 13 years, you would think they'd have perfected it. Nope! There were some nice looking underwater sequences, but beyond that, this movie felt like watching a video game cutscene.

The worst culprit had to be the character models. They ranged from the uncanny valley to goofily disproportionate caricatures. They had to, because no one would be able to tell them apart otherwise. Which one of Jake's two sons died at the end? I have no clue, do you?

How about the story? It was probably worse than the original, and that is saying something. ""Avatar"" (2009) at least had something to say, but the stakes in this sequel were way too low. Take the antagonists, for example. They went from on-the-nose, nevertheless timely depictions of corporate greed and military colonialism. In 2022 they turned them into a few jug heads looking for revenge. They barely even had any motivations. You want revenge on a guy that is actively avoiding conflict and has retired on a distant beach somewhere? He didn't even care that you kidnapped his Tarzan looking kid. You all were in the clear! Why would you risk all your men and resources for that pointless cause? I hate these villains, not because they're evil, but because they're stupid.

The plot did not manage well either. There was so much filler, pointless scenes that did not go anywhere. Were they ever going to explain the miraculous conception at the beginning? Or don't you think Chekhov's epilepsy should come into play later? I don't even like Chekhov, but this movie made me agree with him. I understand why they did not give too many answers. They were trying to set up the sequels, but 3 hrs and 12 minutes of set-up doesn't exactly entice me to see another one. Oh, did I mention it was 3 hrs and 12 minutes? I typically don't mind length, as long as it's used well (teehee), but this one certainly wasn't. It is actually 30 minutes longer than the first, an already weighty movie in its own right. That justifiably should induce a groan from most people.

By far the worst aspect of this film is its characters. Jake Sully was never a good protagonist. His wife, Neytiri, is far more interesting to follow, and yet she felt shelved. Most of the best characters and actors were shelved. For example, have you tried picking Kate Winslet out from the crowd? It's tough. Instead, much of the screen time went to the more undesirable characters, such as the idiotic antagonists or a very obnoxious (and very goofy looking) prepubescent Na'vi child.

Also, why did they have to resurrect half the deceased characters? That is always a cheap move, and frankly, Cameron did not do it well. Nothing justified the Colonel and his loyalists cloning their memories to put into poorly digitally rendered avatars. Why not just introduce a new villain like all the better written sequels out there? Sigourney Weaver ""technically"" played a different character than her first one, yet you could tell it was just her trying to pass as a teenager... And ""try"" she did... With the voice and mannerisms of a 70+ year old woman.

Look, this is not just a bad movie, it is a disappointing movie. The first one was an anomaly. It was a subpar product, too expensive, yet it made more money than the world had ever seen before. This followup had a golden opportunity to take advantage of that, make something special without the risk of failing, and yet they seemed to go backwards in quality while still raking in ungodly amounts of cash.

You can choose to listen to me or not, but I believe we need better standards for the cinema we spend our money on, not just some green screen action films, but something with substance. ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was far from that.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Sometimes just one scene can tell you all you need to know about a film. In Avatar, The Way Of Water it is the Hakuna Matata shot of Blue Guy Número Uno raising up his baby boy to the skies.

That visual cliche sums up the movie. You get a little Tarzan, some old Western train heist mini-movie, a lot of Finding Nemo scenery, and an entire Moby Dick (in Space!) film with a little Dances With Wolves ""white man teaches you how to fight the white man"" for good measure. But when it comes to the story, it's a lot of blue and turquoise cardboard cut-outs tugging at your heart strings. And maybe I'm heartless, but it didn't connect.

Actually, I can't be heartless. I absolutely loved the Baby Shelob The Builder spiders and the crab cabs. I didn't care for the new skinny exoskeletons, but most of the space hardware was space cool. And Pandora *is* pretty. Not so pretty that we need what should be a five second shot last fifty seconds, but at least you can go pee without being worried about missing anything important. It still is the story of a manly man protecting his family because another manly man is trying to harm him. Sure, the manly men are blue, but an important lesson from the movie is that manly men are manly. Also, don't be wasteful and save the environment. But mostly, be manly.

Should you watch it? Sure! Everyone else is. But don't try to be manly and hold your pee for the whole movie. That would be bad for your manly kidneys. And really, you have seen this movie before, just with normal hue humans and a shorter run time.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Visually amazing, but the same war is not expected...

I dare say that its visual effects are impeccable and it will surely win more than one nomination for it.

Likewise the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and equally worthy of many nominations and awards.

I love the development of the characters and especially the whole environment of the new characters with which it is easy to connect and identify.

But definitely what I never expected was the continuation of the same war seen 13 years ago.

For my taste, I need to tell a more solid story that will not revolve around the war already seen in such detail in the first film of 2009.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Yeah it had some decent visuals, at some points absolutely amazing ones, at others, it was so obviously rushed. Mainly when the metkayina are attacked and they all rush off to counter attack, VERY poor CGI in those scenes.

The story was an absolute mess.

I get that Lang wanted revenge for being killed on his last outing, but ffs that is a really really weak plot point that had zero requirements of being in the movie. It made literally no sense whatsoever for earth to spend a fortune on cloning some guys, and shipping them to space just to get revenge on a single guy who isn't even in the fight anymore.

Spyders war paint is constantly being touched up in the beginning scenes, only to not be touched in the latter 3/4 of the movie, and yet it looks like it's permanently been freshly done.

Wildly inconsistent on the water breathing made very little sense.

I'll concede that it wasn't shown how much time Jake and Nyteri spent learning their new way of life, but the kids were definitely able to spend a lot of time underwater without issues, yet at the very end it was a seeming impossibility that they spend 2 or 3 minutes to get out of the sinking ship.

To go along with this, all the wonderful animals that seem to respond to their daughter, she goes and snags a convenient air balloon backpack one, but doesn't think ahead in the slightest to have a half dozen or so follow her into the ship for her rescue attempt, because that simply wouldn't make any sense...

The humans supposed reasoning for hunting the torkun, to get some magical life halting serum... OK sure yup totally possible that this magical serum exists, but how in the world was this discovered ????? Absolutely nothing about the whales was easy hunting, so first it's unlikely that the humans just happened to kill one, second, it's unlikely anyone happened to drill into it's skull 3 feet to drain a random fluid that up until that point would be just ""a fluid"", and third, who's testing out drinking or injecting random brain fluids for YEARS and evaluating that it apparently stops the aging process???? No one. Literally NO ONE. Because the odds of finding it are slim, and even slimmer that they'd be testing it for anti aging.

The main thought I had during the movie was how much it mirrored what happened to native Americans. How new vastly superior technology was brought to bear against them.

All in all it was a mostly beautiful film that made very little sense.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I never understood the hype around the first movie. The visuals were great but everything else was kinda lackluster. Same with this one. Lots of people love it because of the visuals, which yeah they're amazing, but everything else lacks. The story is simple, and at some points bad, the character work makes no sense, and there is lots of bad acting. The only good ones really are Sam Worthington, Gamora, and Stephen Lang. The start of the movie gets right into the action, which can make it feel rushed at points which is weird because the movies like 3 hours long. The second act slows down, but I honestly enjoyed it. And then the third act is pure action and chaos, which again I enjoyed, but just because I enjoy something doesn't make it good. The final act is insanely messy and convoluted that it is hard to overlook. But anyways I thought it was an enjoyable movie that was mostly saved by visuals.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"With a direct representation of what's happening in the world today woven into this digital beauty, they really had a chance to tell a more thought provoking story.

Humans mining the earth and robbing it of it's resources for profit and people starting to look at ancient native wisdom for answers, They had a chance to rewrite this current story with in-depth characters and a progressive narrative. Instead what was delivered was a recycled cliché action movie that's been done over and over and over again! Snore! They didn't even bother giving the bad guys a look in, they were just simply there to fill in the space and eventually be killed.

It was hopelessly boring and predictable, the only thing that held it up was the fact it looked astounding.

Unfortunately for Avatar there's an impeccably high level of writing available in abundance through the median that is tv shows, audiences have a high standard now with so much amazing entertainment available. Let's hope they do better on the next one.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Do I think it's a waste of time? Yes. Does my brain hurt after this? Yes. The VFX is AMAZING, so I guess here's 5 stars, which is below average if you think about it. This is such a cis white male's messiah complex (maybe less so than the first movie), but there do be one point that makes the series unique: humankind, in general, is the actual (one dimensional flat) villian here. Genuine kudos to James Cameron for being brave enough to do this in front of an earth full of human. But this also puzzles me, in the sense that the hero of the movie, being an avatar, is essentially an immigrant on Pandora that fully outgrowed his past identity as a human. Even though this is purely fictional, people would inevitably think of its real-life parallel. And if you stare at this parallel long enough, you will start to feel uncomfortable about what potential messages the movie might carry.

Here are some notes I made during my first (and only) watch:",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Avatar: The Way of Water follows a well worn path blazed by much greater stories such as Dances with Wolves. The acting is average and the narrative choice of a protagonist embracing the ways of an indigenous people in the face of an encroaching technologically advanced civilization follows all the old clichés. The lines are some of the worst words ever put to pen. Viewing underwater alien beings communicating with a space whale through sign language left me wondering if I was suffering from a stroke. In spite of all these weak story telling elements the visual brilliance of the film cannot be overstated. The underwater sequences transport the viewer into an ethereal realm of beauty and wonder. The symphony of colors, textures and movements takes one's breath away. The effects to be fully appreciated should be viewed in 3D, a medium rarely done right, blow this movie out of the water. The aquatic tapestry of Avatar: The Way of Water saves the film from drowning in its own mediocrity.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Pointless overkill in violence for what could easily have remained a family film without it. Insulting trope of women being emotional and needing aloof men to calm them down. Death of child/sibling trivialized in the face of entire theme of family sticking together. The majesty and beauty of the film is wasted on graphic violence and threats and mutilation and graphic kills. Glad they fired Disney CEO over this film.

Lazy filmmaking if all you can devise is graphic killing. Imagine Harry Potter with machine guns, or any other fantasy film. Even star wars is visually striking without resorting to hardcore violence. He's trashed this sequel. Hope he won't make more.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"It have good cgi but story is as stale as a food can be.

Basically it's a very average family movie story.

Jake sully the main hero of the movie was not used at all. They could have made this movie without him.

No magic moments in movie, just a good cgi and VFX.

They wasted this part in introducing his children and specially Grace daughter that she could be a superhero in Avatar movie.

Representative attempt of losing kids and fighting to get them back was a loop.

Apart from new kids, all old characters are live now as a Avatar no that itself a bogus attempt to continue story.

It just doesn't make any sense.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Someone enjoyed creating all the CGI, but forgot about a reasonable plot. Hour two of the film seemed to forget there was even a plot with endless underwater swimming sequences rather than getting on with it. Needed to be faster moving for me and the small part for Sigourney Weaver added nothing other than minor sentimentality.

All a bit predictable with some characters unsure if they were a cat or a Moirai warrior. Clearly the end was set for another sequel which will probably hit the screens in 2030.

After such a long time in the making, the film as a whole was disappointing and generally forgettable. If they make a third film it needs to do much better than this one.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I regret not checking reviews/synopsis before wasting money on a ticket and 3+ hours in a cinema with too loud sound system. So uncomfortable! I felt like that kid in the torture/interrogation scene watching this mess of a movie. Almost got a nose bleed myself and left before the final fight.

Anyway... IMO, could've been way, way better and truly groundbreaking if they just made it more subtle, slow paced to enjoy the stunning visuals and get immersed in the Avatar universe. Instead they made it way too cluttered. Standard Hollywood BS action and senseless plot! It's about time storytelling, and film art in general, to step up to the advances of technology if they want to create a true masterpiece, otherwise it is just a cluttered, mediocre kitsch.

ATWOW's definitely a miss. Sad, because it had a lot going for it: The underlying plot and philosophy, the main characters, an established universe... It was all there but they went for the standard, outdated formula and made another movie that is over saturated with action and plot twists, spoiled with smarty-pants dialog and overblown with theatrics and characters egos etc.

Just proves good directing, good actors, record breaking budget and tech isn't enough to make a good movie.

All the hype and hysteria even when we were facing global environment issues... Perhaps in the future movies like this will reflect the state of mind of today's society and serve well as retrospect.

One thing for sure: They certainly know how to play on the success of the first and secure the financial success of this move.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Look, this film is an absolute mess. It's an hour longer than it needs to be, the writing is absolutely abysmal at times and most of the characters are annoying as hell. But even then, I still had such a great time watching it. In some ways I love this film, it encapsulates the ""blockbuster movie"" experience so well that, at several moments, tricked me into believing I was actually watching something good.

When you stand back and look at the film as a whole confined experience it is just plain odd. When I walked out of the cinema the one word I kept describing it with was weird. It is weird, weird, weird. It blew me away honestly, how they could get so much bang on perfect and so much astoundingly awful. I suppose I'll start talking specifics now, refraining from any spoilers of course.

The first 15 or so minutes of the film felt like I was watching a video game cutscene, and this is a problem which plagued a lot of the film for me. A lot of the time I struggled to view the story from the perspective of any one character, greatly detaching me from the events taking place. I think most of this can be explained by the rather strange way this film is shot and edited at times. There are many sequences in the film that look beautiful, don't get me wrong. But at other times I was extremely confused over what the cinematographer's aim was. On countless occasions the camera would do this awkward zoom-in which made it feel like I was watching some kind of nature documentary, and, during many of the action set-pieces the editing was cut together so quickly when the scene would have greatly benefitted from longer takes. Overall, this contributed to the feeling that I was just watching a pure spectacle, rather than a character driven story. And yes, maybe that was intended and if so, fair enough. But if that is the case then what is the point spending so much screen time attempting to develop your characters, because I can tell you, I didn't care about a single one.

I'm not going to go into the plot at all, but wow, it is certainly nothing unique or special. Of course, I wasn't expecting it to be and I'm sure that the same can be said for Avatar 1, not that I can remember any of it. Let's just say, don't expect anything you haven't seen a hundred times before, this is just your basic action, adventure storyline, which is totally OK if they nail the visuals and the climatic set pieces, everyone knows what's going to happen so just make the journey as enjoyable as possible. So, did Avatar 2 achieve this?

For the most part yes. It almost feels stupid for me to praise the visual effects and CGI because they are so obviously fantastic. However, I think its important for me to mention that there are some sequences, particularly those that are underwater, that I thought were worth the cost of viewing alone. Some sections of this film are just jaw-droppingly beautiful to gaze at, it is a triumphant achievement in visual effects. However, saying this, they still haven't completely nailed it yet. A lot of the shots which involved an avatar and human character in the same frame really pulled me out of it. I'm not sure whether it was a lighting issue or something, but they never felt they were truly taking up the same physical space. My absolute favourite aspect of the film was the sound. They did such an outstanding job with the foley. I could feel every footstep and every drop of rain, definitely worth the cinema experience! I loved it and, as per usual, the score was fantastic. The Avatar theme is definitely one of my favourites, fits the film perfectly.

So, the most important question, should you watch it? If I had to give you a straight answer I would say yes, it is worth watching. The sound and visuals alone make this a wonderful experience in cinemas, something I'm sure most people were expecting. It's just such a shame that the film falls short in almost every other aspect of its presentation, and I've limited my rating to a 4 because of this. If I were to rate it on my pure enjoyment, I would have to give it an 8, but that's not how I rate films.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I'll try to keep my review brief but it is a movie over 3h long.

Positive:
CGI and all of the underwater sequences looked fantastic, as they should considering the effort put into them.


Introduction of the sea life was superior to the first movie, as in they felt more realistic and less shiny or rigid.


This was awesome 3D and really enhanced the underwater elements beautifully. Even when bullets were flying towards you they didn't blur or anything like that.


Negatives:

lack of progression in the story. It really was basically a rehash of the first movie. It skipped over bits in the story which would have been far better explored than what we got.


the characters. Jake and Ney'tiri were really just bland in this movie. Jake was just a soldier who seemed to complained at his kids or was grovelling. Ney'tiri was either angry or sad. I'm not sure if either of them smiled all movie or had any real meaningful moment that was spent so long developed in the first. There were far too many characters to either keep track of or truly care about because again, they skipped over it for the revenge storyline. Kiri, Lo'ak and Neteyam were my favourites of the kids. I truly have no idea why they added Tuk or Spider into the mix, they really didn't add any substance.


character development. They were developing Kiri's storyline nicely and then it just fizzled out and became nonsensical. They showed her with her mum but then she left really easily. She started to have seizures but magically all good. Really annoying as I thought something interesting was going to eventuate. Lo'ak was well developed for a one-dimensional character, but again, we've already had this storyline in Jake. Neteyam I thought might be the true leader coming through and even developed his storyline to be maybe something of Jake's brother where he was a scientist who was interested in exploring, was really levelheaded but then has the leadership qualities of Jake and Ney'tiri. But they just sort of killed him off because the good guys needed to lose someone. Kill off spider or Tuk, that would have made more sense to me. The also kept setting Spider up with something with his dad but that just fizzled out and he didn't confront Jake or Ney'tiri about killing his dad. It would have made more sense if Spider had killed him.


Completely under-utilised previous characters for anything meaningful again. Because it's just a revenge movie, they didn't provide any substance.


The Metkayina people were one dimensional too, although very well created. They were just character copies of the Navi.


What really bothered me was how easy the marines were comfortable with the environment and bonded with the animals. I wish after Spider's speech about doing bonding traditionally that he would have still darted it.


The whole ""ambergris"" dumb storyline and stupid characters. Why did the pilot and crew wear sunglasses when all the instrumentation was digital and screens? Eh.


Anyway, there's other minor negative reasons too but they're just finer detail things. After seeing this movie, I wish it had come out in 2014 like originally planned and that we saw the chapter before this one. You know that this really is a middle movie that it just feels like filler. I did expect more from JC.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"This movie was a letdown. The graphics may do it for some people, but the plot was non-existent. Most of the time it felt like a direct copy of other movies: lion king (the holding up of the baby to the sun//star and then again leaving the offspring off in a ""forbidden zone"") Black Panther: pretty much the whole movie feels like black panther 2 continuance.

Titanic: the end scenes Terminator: just the random, wanton violence and destruction.

3 hrs is too long for this movie. There should be congressional approval needed for movies longer than 3 hrs.

I am reluctant to criticize James Cameron creations, but this certainly was a huge disappointment.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"The movie was so boring that I preferred going out to buy snacks without feeling even once that I need to hurry back to the screen.

The story is a drag and the logic driving the movie completely non-sensical and lame. It's fine that the director wants to showcase his visuals around a water theme but then he should have taken some more pain with the plot to ensure that the plot is driving the movie to the water rather than the visuals driving sinking the plot into the water.

The plot just keeps hitting new lows.

The kids would and might enjoy the movie but it surely isn't for anyone who wants some substance in the story than just stunning visuals. Even the visuals become an overdose after a while.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"I knew years ago how the next Avatar were going to be and it was just as expected. I was not surprised at all about how bad it was and what it was going to be about.

I got tormented for 3 hours because my girlfriend wanted to se it day one. Funny though half way through out the movie she said ""what is this crap, I want to go home"" and I answered with ""I told you so""

All the hype and all those high ratings by people and critics shows the difference between someone who really knows about cinema and who have been watching movies their whole life like me here, and others who easily affected by visuals and main stream. Which is also applies to video games these days.

I won't go into details really because I would have to write for hours about so many things that were faulty and incredibly bad.

So many actors were bad and what even worst so many characters was unbelievably pure crap and did not make any sense at all. The story is by far one of the most boring and common stories you can get from a children's Disney movie. The dialogue, lines and script is so bad I was really tortured.

If you actually compare the visuals with the first one then they're on par which makes the visuals actually outdated. If you look closely every little CGI was noticeable and average at best by today's standards for being a movie.

If you someone who watched thousand of movies and also play a lot of high end games. You would se that Avatar CGI nothing special now days nothing special at all.

When the movie ended no one clapped and no one was happy. The disappointment on every bodies face was so clear and I would hear here and there people bashing the hell out of the movie.

Movie a solid 5/10 at best and the popcorn was also 5/10 because of too much salt.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"**LITTLE SPOILERS BUT LOTS OF EMOTIONS**

I have not yet watched the first movie, however the movie still makes some sense. I make apologies since the comment is purely based on my personal experience with the film.

The perfect measure word for this movie is ""a piece"". Not a piece of artwork, but a piece of ****. I can't believe that after Cameron criticizes so hard on Super Heroes movies he decided to make THIS. A 3 HOURS LONG WELL-EDITED MUSIC VIDEO. My ADHD started hitting right after watching this for 20 minutes. I was squirming in my seat. Sure this might be a "" me problem"" but those vivid visuals with endless fighting scenes drove me crazy.

I left the theatre hearing a few people commenting on the stereotypical ""mother roles""- women being great warriors albeit being overprotective towards their loved ones. But I think Cameron just has a thing against humanity, doesn't matter men or women. He portrays majority of the human group as selfish invaders. I guess it aligns with the theme of ""desires vs love"". It is almost like one of those educational environmentalism movies your high school teacher makes you watch and study from.

The central message of the movie is VAGUE yet the characters are flat- straightforward motivation. Traditional character traits. Protective mother, strong father, sensitive sister, rebellious younger brother with a role model older brother, along with a young sister whose role is to be protected and make ""funny"" lines. I do not understand why he made an entire movie just for a migration story.

Honestly I would appreciate this movie more if it's shortened to about 2-2.5 hours. But who cares? It's just me screaming my own opinions here and I've never watched Avatar 1 or Titanic anyways.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Had little high hopes, but this sequel was disappointing one compared to the first part .The movie had many plot holes and the story line was very weak . This movie is all about a typical Hollywood action movie with Pandora VFX. They shows how Na'vi people start behaving just like homosapiens and even speak English mostly which did not sense.

VFX was also mediocre in my opinion, nothing improved with newer technology not sure how this took 10+ years!! What disappointed me most was single geared story and it was so quick about not showing way of water life !

Watching this movie reminded me of watching l last episode of games of thrones!",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"Time and again watching this bloated drawn out mess, the same thought came to mind. ""Why didn't this sequence end up on the cutting room floor""?

James Cameron needs to get an independent producer in. Someone who isn't him. I would like to see a ""Producer's cut"" of this movie, with Cameron politely but firmly shut out of the editing suite.

At 3 hours 12 minutes the run time is longer than the original Avatar (2 hours 42 minutes). Obviously it should be the other way round!

And no way is the correct rating 7.5. For context the original Avatar is 7.9. A rating gap of 0.4 is plainly not representative of the very obvious quality gap between the two movies. It will probably settle over the next few years to a more objective low end 6.",4

If that had happened then we would have had a great film with wonderful effects. Instead its just great effects film which just leads on to the next (which I don't think I will watch as I know whats coming). The effects must be costing so much that the studio is determined to squeeze the most out of it while it can.

Overall a disappointing experience which could have been so much better.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"This movie is a perfect example of how it takes more than the latest special effects techniques, and CGI graphics, to turn the movie into a hit. While the visuals are notably spectacular, and the realism of the animated characters are very lifelike, the story lacks the essential elements to make this movie as much of a hit as the first one. The storyline seems contrite and difficult to follow. If you do not manage to grasp the concept of what Cameron is trying to convey in the first 20 minutes then you will be lost for the rest of the movie. There is no doubt this movie smashed the box, office records, but this may have been from the initial fanfare and newlywed relationship with it. I feel that once the publics love affair with the movie exits the honeymoon phase the box, office, receipts, will decline I anticipate this movie moving to a streaming platform in a few months from now. I am a very big fan of James Cameron's work and enjoy almost every movie he has made, but sometimes sequels don't hit the mark as is the case with this one. If you are a diehard Avatar fan, give it a shot, otherwise give it a miss. Hopefully this mediocre storyline will not set the tone for the upcoming Avatar 3 and 4 releases due to be released by 2025.",4
Avatar: The Way of Water,"First of all, I think this movie is beautiful and I'm not sorry for going to the movies and buying the ticket.

The world that was created is remarkable and I'm in awe with imagination of the creators, really extraordinary.

But the story is in my opinion just an opposite - it is lacking imagination and it is a shame that this rich world has such a poor story and language. This use of the word ""bro"" is so annoying and unnecessary and I don't understand that at all. Overall language in the script feels poor and english is not my mother tongue.

The plot just makes the characters look a little bit stupid, I'm sorry.

They are nice and interesting, but their actions are making them look stupid and use of ""bro"" doesn't help either.

At the last third of the movie I had a feeling, that the same plot is repeating with change of different scenery, but at least the scenery is so impressive, that you can overcome repeating plot theme without falling asleep.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Everything here is yawn inducing, obviously except one sequence of around 5 minutes. The witty chats were the worst part of this awful offering. This one is full of pseudo-talent. The direction, the acting and just about everything lacks quality. A disrespect to the viewer considering the hype surrounding it and the money it made. Add to the mix the fairly decent rating it has been awarded, and one starts questioning the sanity of his world.:-). This one surely differentiates the real from fake. All the ones who found it bad are the real ones, the rest I am still wondering about. Recommended for robots, rest may stay away.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This film was so bad. I felt like washing my tongue with fairy liquid to clean my tongue from ever even saying the name of this movie. It was the worst film I had ever seen next to Twilight, absolute abysmal. The worst of the worst films it was so abysmal that one would even consider watching a film rated 0.5 out of 10. The overall development of the villain in the film was underwhelming. No real build up and no nothing. Throw it into the deepest part of a black hole. If you liked it then throw yourself there with the film. A poor follow up from the acclaimed Avengers film. Absolutely pathetic. A sadistic piece of monstrosity the likes of which will never be seen again. Of there was half a star I would do it. However there isn't. Unfortunately this garbage leads to some of the best films of all time. So you kinda have to watch it. It's like having a husband/wife who doesn't do anything but you are kinda messed because you said yes on the marriage day. So you kinda have to stick with them. Treat this vomit the same. A mandatory nonsense that you kinda have to watch.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Why spend money on watching the Avengers: Age of Ultron? It's a completely unoriginal story, a waste of time and a total rip-off from Transformers, Iron Man and the first Avengers movie. The action scenes happens way too fast and often, an obvious attempt to cover up a week screenplay. Sad to say it also mocks people standing up for clean language – Captain America's famous line ""Language!"" kept getting a lot of heat from the obnoxious Iron Man. Speaking of Iron Man, they might as well have called this movie Iron Man 4 – it's all about him and his major blunder of creating artificial intelligence – apparently there are not enough villains in the world, so let's invent our own. If you're looking for an awesome sequel with same integrity (clean language) then Avengers: Age of Ultron is not for you. Just watch the first Avengers movie again, or Captain America 1 and 2 – the action is basically the same.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"All around horrible movie. The writing was awful, the atmosphere was worse, and the actors honestly looked like they would be anywhere else half the time.

Avengers: Age of Ultron,Really? The same old story of all Germans being evil Nazis? I think the people making these films need to take a closer look at the demographics of the American population and reconsider the same old story of hatred for the Germans over a war that war was 75 years ago. I'm part Jewish and am still getting sick of Hollywood spinning hatred about something they can't get over instead of sending a message of unity and humanity trying to get along with each other going forward. Using Hollywood to try and brainwash people into enough hatred to start another war just isn't going to happen. This has gotten ridiculous. I'm sick of the hate. Get over it.,1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"If I had been at the cinema I would have walked out. I hated it. I don't even know what it was about because I could not watch more than 5 minutes without being too bored to pay attention. I haven't disliked a movie so much since Hulk with Eric Bana. It started with a mystifying and unexplained battle and it just went down from there. I got bored right from the beginning and after 20 minutes I put in my noise canceling earphones to block out this rubbish noise. I still have no idea what it was about and I still don't care. Worst movie ever...Hated it hated it hated it. ugh...I want my time back. And I am really perplexed at how this has such a high rating. I have read 5 pages of ratings to see if maybe it's just me that doesn't like it, but the first 5 pages are nearly all 1 and 2 star ratings. I don't get it.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The costumes alone look like they were designed for a middle school play. I mean, you can't blame the actors for taking the money...I get it...the crew needs to work...but it's got to be embarrassing to be in something that looks this bad, and clearly the crew is getting no help from the ""storytellers"" at Marvel. Marvel movies generally are poorly made and badly written but WOW. Ouch.

I think what's worse is that no scrutiny is required to come to this conclusion. You could walk in on this movie at any point and immediately see that it's poorly done. Captain America's outfit alone should have been enough to stop the studio from making any more of these movies.

I would go as far as saying this isn't a movie, it's an 2.5hour long ad you pay to see. A huge disappointment and actually disrespectful to real film makers like Nolan, Wes A and Quentin.",1

Didn't like it at all!",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Sounds kinda familiar doesn't it?

That doesn't mean its bad. Its just a bit disappointing. It was great cinema, enjoyed every second. But thats why it gets the 6 point rating.

->Good VFX? Check. ->Funny? Check. ->Nice memorable scenes? Check. -> Scarlett Johansson? Checkity Check Check.

->Awesome plot? Nope.

I wasn't hooked onto the story as much I was hooked on to Tony Starks sarcasm. There were no serious motives anywhere, or a point to the story much. Kind of uneven, and no real character development.

Remember how the first movie's ending fight scene gave everybody a really vital role to culminate into an ultimate win? This one didn't. Hell, the ending fight scene didn't even really need all the heroes of The Avengers much. Plus, their win was kinda weird as well.

WAT THE FRUCK WAS UP WITH NATASHA AND THE HULK? LIKE SERIOUSLY WUT?

The affection and lullaby stuff was nice, but really really out of the blue. There was no development towards this in any of the previous marvel movies.

Also, remember the end of the previous film of this installment? Where the question was whether or not the avengers were right for the world. This one didn't really provoke any development or thoughts.

As I mentioned above, great cinema, go and watch it, in 3D. They did everything. They just didn't go over the top like I had hoped they would.

Disappointing Marvel.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Without a plot description, it could have been anyone's guess what is happening during the 2 hours. On the plus side, it is nice to have the summary if you fall asleep.

I have enjoyed some of the past Marvel productions, but this one is boring, smell from bad acting, lack of humor. So far the worst of those I have seen.

On the plus side, the technical effects are great, tons of screens with information, animations of robots, airplanes, highway pursue, the lot - but of course pointless if you start to analyze any of the scenes.

How come so many films nowadays is endless special effect and no acting or plot?

In my youth I was an avid Marvel fan, read all the comic, too bad those who produce films don't have a clue?

The story was awful as it was made for an audience rating from 4-12 year olds, you don't have to have explosions every 5s of the movie. The dialog was probably the worst part in this movie REALLY WTF everything they say is a line like they are trying to impress you i mean REALLY the dialog would have been better if they ware all silent for the whole movie.

OK you are going to enjoy this move if mindless carnage and endless destruction is your thing but for me this is just some video of things blowing up. I don't know why they got such high reviews on most sites because i don't know if i watched a more terrible movie in my life.

If you watch this movie i mean watch it you can pretty much see everything that is going to happen in the movie from the first 20min of the film.

-------- Raiting: -------- Story: 1/10 Dialog: -2/10 Effects: 8/10

In conclusion the movie is good if you have children in the house so they can go child #1:"" waaaa"", child #2:""awesome"", child #3:""i want to see it another 128 times"", but if you are looking for something whit a story, something whit a good dialog look elsewhere, this movie is about blowing stuff up and nothing more.

-------- Spoiler: -------- The whole movie talks about them trying to clean there own mess up, and yeee blow up an entire city but no repercussions, i know this is make-believe but come on if you blow up a city are you really a good guy (don't even start, haters it was their fault that the city was flying no mater how you look at it in the eyes of there world they are the bad guys).",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"We open with a battle in a forest and a castle. The action in the forest is similar to a scene in one of the early Star Wars films. The combination of live action characters, CGI and what may or may not be partially real locations looks like a very well rendered video game. In other words it looks fake and for me has the immediate effect of taking me out of the action. The CGI throughout the film is often very clunky. The mania for 3D is dying down now but it's about time that overuse of CGI went the same way. There's nothing wrong with CGI per se but when a film relies so extensively on it, you can't help but notice it.

The film is nearly two and a half hours in length, though it feels a lot longer. It would have been a much better, tighter film at ninety minutes. Basically you get overlong pieces of exposition followed by some sub-Transformers crash, bang, blow stuff up scenes – again and again and again and again. The one liners that frequent this film are a Joss Whedon trademark but the rest of the dialogue seldom rises above the jokes. The plot is barely comprehensible and certainly makes little sense.

It gives me no pleasure to criticise Whedon's work and I can't help but wonder how much of this film is really what he wanted to see on screen and how much of it was mandated by the studio. He's a big earner now but this is miles away from the excellent work he has done in the past. I can only hope he returns to more creative projects sometime in the near future. The work being done on the new Daredevil series by some of his former collaborators such as Doug Petrie and Drew Goddard shows how you can do justice to a Marvel superhero without compromising your principles.",1

I don't usually write reviews but I am so disappointed with the movie that I don't know where to begin!

On the other hand Disney does not allow their characters to swear(sic) , but provides us with a gazillion products' placements during the movie.Only Super Goofy is missing from Avengers to make it a total Disney movie..",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"It's not often I watch a film where I haven't got a clue what's going on, but that's what happened in the case of Avengers: Age of Ultron: come the ending, I still hadn't the foggiest about what I'd just watched. The plot, if you can describe it thus, seems to be about a young man who's advised to commit suicide by his aged mentor, only to return as an ass-kicking 'Avenger' with special supernatural powers. His job? To bump off the rest of the 'avenger warriors' that are out there.

There's some fanboy mumbo-jumbo talk in an effort to explain the discrepancies of the plot, but you'll be bypassing that in favour of checking out the various Avengers and their special skills. By far the most interesting is an immortal fighter whose body bears the scars of each person he's killed – a neat idea that sadly isn't explore to the fullest extent, as it could have been with a more skilled writer behind it. In some ways, this is like a grown-up version of Barney and Friends, with the addition of a series of bloody and sadistic fight scenes.

There's action aplenty, and lots of CGI blood, but the choreography is pretty poor, it has to be said. Even worse is the script, which makes no effort to characterise each of the principals, so that the Avengers themselves are more often than not interchangeable. The acting is dodgy to say the least, and director Jock Whedon needs to go back to film school to figure out how to make a real movie next time, instead of this silly, noisy nonsense.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Vision's origin (and Ultron's) is completely screwed up (again, no Hank Pym) and he (and Ultron) are nothing extraordinary. This was the problem as predicted since Iron Man (2008) with JARVIS instead of Jarvis and Iron Man 3 (2013) with JARVIS already being a hero and having a body – multiple bodies – via independent control of the various armors.

Vision's looks such as skin and eyes are also a complete departure from the source material and the actor playing him wasn't interested in the role, only the amount of money an utterly misguided director offered for him to take it, someone who was said to be a ""purist"" regarding the source material, at least as far as Iron Man's chest plate. Apparently that's only for armor, not androids. (I'd have been more okay with something like John Byrne's take than this. I saw where the director quit Twitter; maybe he should stay on Twitter, quit Hollywood and comics.) The best to be hoped for from that is that the actor's disinterest comes across as Vizh's normally stolid personality, but even Vision did talk shows to (re)acquaint himself to the public with his ""Second Debut"" (comics.org/issue/46843); this guy wouldn't.

Scarlet Witch's powers are also completely altered and nothing unique – just ""The Avengers' Jean Grey.""

If you're a fan of either of these pillars of Avengers membership, pass on AoU. If you do go, remember, you _can_ walk out and ask for a refund (a credit/pass for another movie means your attendance/receipt is still counted for ""Ugh-vengers"" and you can't use it for a new release), but you can't un-see it.",1

Plus, Quicksilver and Wanda are Magnetos kids - in that case, where the F**K are any mutants during these films?

Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I disliked the first ""Avengers"" movie quite much, but thought to myself ""well, this movie is not about the plot or the quality, it's about big explosions and interesting fighting scenes that you only get if you break the laws of nature"" I would not have watched it a second time, but then I saw that the sequel ""Age of Ultron"" received ratings from 4-5 stars from any source I'd seen so I gave it a chance. .... To quote ""Family Guy"": The last thing that got me THAT confused was ""Transformers 3"": ""Why do they still allow these guys to make movies???"" .... This movie is for children, not for adults or anything between! Eight year-olds might forget about the repetition, the redundance, the lack of anything a brain is made for. And that's OK! This movie has around the same amount of content as a Disney Channel production, when I was a child I loved the Disney Channel. But nobody would give a Disney Channel production a HIGHER rating than ""Interstellar"", ""Gravity"", ""Sweeney Todd"" or ""Ex Machina"" (and yes, also ""Avatar"")! .... It is OK, if the user-rating is merely an indicator for the profitability of a movie, this is a big help for anybody who wants to create a movie. But in my opinion it is the responsibility of so called ""EXPERTS"" to give a rating based on QUALITY and ARTISTIC VALUE! This is necessary to promote movie-companies' effort on creating innovative and sophisticated movies too.

Because money will always be more attracted to popcorn-cinema, at least our and the experts' respect should give those who really put effort into making a great movie, and who sometimes take great risk, the reward that they deserve.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"First Things first. The movie is OK. Good Character Development, good story and good action. The hulkbuster fight scene is breathtaking, though I'm a bit disappointed that they almost released the entire scene before the release of the movie.

Now, things that were... let's say, a little bit less spectacular. The love story between Black Widow and Hulk seemed a bit forced. Not that the pair looked bad, but shall we say they don't get much on screen time to develop their chemistry; given in their last movie they were just team mates.

The final battlefield was less spectacular than the previous avenger or the winter soldier movie. And the humor element seemed missing.

The real gem in the movie is Ultron. A good villain who seeks peace. Just his meaning of peace is a bit twisted. In the last scene he asks Scarlet Witch to leave the castle or else she'll die. This shows his caring aspect a bit.

QUicksilver and Scarlet Witch were awesome in the final battle. Thor lacked any significant battle, and frankly I expected a little more from the team.

But it's just me. After setting the standards with the first Avengers Movie, maybe I expected a lot more than what the director could offer.

Instead of setting premise for the future movies, I would liked it to focus more on the present movie.

Oh.. well. I guess the future movie might be the real deal. Waiting for it.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I could have guessed, that a piece created by joss Whedon would be the reason for me to give my first review. but I would have never ever guessed that it could be to give a bad review. the movie seemed to me like Whedon sold his soul to Michael Bay and Brett Ratner. the story was plain, boring and uninspired. I want a movie that produces tension. but sorry', CGI, explosions and fast pictures are no tension. the worst were the characters. just plain dull exchangeable action figures struggling with very bad dialogs just to lose all kind of individuality and depth that they build up before.

this movie is a great example that Hollywood forgot that a good movie tells a story and is not told be explosions. if someone like Whedon can fall on a Michael-Bay-like level of quality then there is no reason left for me to watch anything ever again in the cinema.",1

I mean, come on, artificial intelligence stuff against such big perceived marvel super heroes..... Who wanted this unreasonably odd fantasy??? And the way the scene of defending that blast key has been filmed is really too ........ comical. More than needed comic punches are another distracting feature. At time literally I felt as I m watching another project of Scary Movie Team.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This movie was wavering on average throughout the first hour and a half of the movie, for many reasons, throughout the movie there were terrible plot holes, and the ending can only be described as just as bad as Iron Man 3. You can not send the two best avengers off to somewhere else, and show a new team assembling and expect viewers to be happy about it. Iron Man and Thor are the most important parts of the avengers and the movie just decided to get rid of them at the end. This movie would've been much better if they took out the last 5 minutes. Because of the ending, this movie really deserves zero stars. I would not recommend spending 8-10 dollars to go see this movie in theatres, you would be wasting your money.",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I really enjoyed the first Iron Man and Captain America. Unique. Good plotting. Good script. Then the sequels began and CGI a flash-bang took over. This one bored me from the start. The troops storm the castle. Been there, seen that. Tony Stark's ego expands until it bursts on the screen like an over-expanded bowel, and he creates Ultron without doing his homework. The rest was so snoring that I quit when Ultron joins the bad guys. I could care less about any of the characters by then. They opened Pandora's Box and now everyone has to live with it. Well, thank you Avengers and good-bye. That's another promising franchise flushed down the toilet.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This is the worst marvel film yet. First hour was boring, hubby went to bed, as a huge fan I was determined to give it a go though! I get the plot. Has something to do with an AI that stark had created, which somehow came to life so to speak, with the most stupid personality, kind of a baddie with a bad sense of humour, something which just didn't go. The film didn't start with them all getting together again and finding out what they had been up too and how tony got all his tech back, no, started with them hunting Loki's staff . No mention of anything before that. It just made no sense all the way through, cgi nonsense. Best bit was Jarvis coming to life but that got boring after 10 minutes too and that is only because Paul Bethany is hot. Glad I rented for free and didn't buy it, it is really bad. So gutted and disappointed it is unreal. Worse than guardians of the galaxy and that was a terrible film, but I expected that to be terrible, I had higher hopes for this, maybe that was my fault? Anyone who says this was a good film either has no clue about films or works for marvel.first avengers film was tight with a good plot line plenty of action this is drivel...",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I'm not a comic book fan, but I liked the earlier stories like Captain America, the Hulk, typically involving one key character and their story. This had too many characters all trying to be centre of attention, far too much going on, it felt like a mess of a film. Lot's of great CGI and explosions and stuff, but without a coherent story to follow I found this film tedious.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Warning this review contains spoilers turn back now.

3,2,1! This movie f*ckin' sucks.This doesn't come close to the first one. The first one was almost as good as the Dark knight. This is just loud stupid bullsh*t!! When I was at the midnight party for this movie I knew exactly what was going to happen. It would start with a monlogue from Thanos.

Then, The trailer from pixels was finished then I looked down at my phone and I look back up and there is already an action scene. Yep, looked at my phone for 5 seconds and there was a giant battle in the forest already! This is the exact opposite of Iron Man 2. Iron Man 2 has a great story but hardly any action.

This has NO!!! story but only has action. There are just a couple sequences without action to break it up. All the action scenes look so fake they are all CGI and it felt like was watching f*cking PIXAR! Ultron looks like a cartoon he looks so fake even I could do better than they did and I'm only 17 f*cking years old.

And the comedy is exactly the same as the first one. Which makes it not funny because I've seen the first one like 10 times. Then we get to HULKBUSTER when I saw hulkbuster in the trailer I thought this is gonna be the best movie EVER!!!!!!!!! It just turned into Man of Steel he destroys the cheap set that they used. And he was fighting hulk. Then Hulkbuster got destroyed. More like Hulkbusted.

Then we find out Clint Barton has a wife and a kid. Blah blah blah.

Then we get to one of the worst action scenes I've ever seen and it lasts the rest of the movie which is an HOUR! I couldn't follow what was happening at all. Then more property is damaged and stuff referring to Man of steel which also sucks. I don't even care!!!!

Then shield is back somehow?? Didn't it get destroyed in Captain America Winter Soldier. Well F*CK THAT. Then Thanos is given a one liner then the movie's over. This movie doesn't even matter you could skip this one entirely and you wouldn't be lost at all watching the rest of the movies!!

Yeah, Yeah fanboy. ""But the ending was awesome because of the, action."" ""SHUT UP!!!""",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The Avengers are out for a quick winter fight , whilst kicking baddies hindquarters , Ironman ponders Captain America's views on foul language. After jokes all around , as the attack worsens, the iron legion is called in to protect a public that could care less. After destroying the enemy base and discovering they are not the only mutants causing mayhem in The world , they fly back to base with Loki's Scepter which itself is trouble. Also , the Iron Legion returns cut down to size by its local critics. Whilst Barton is healing , Stark poses a Man Sized ""If"" to Banner. This triggers a Cold War debate about Shields and AI. However , every hard working billionaire , playboy , philanthropists have hosting responsibilities to their party guests. Sadly , Ultron arrives early and is clearly uninvited. The good news he may be the solution to world peace , the bad news he sounds to much like James Spader.

Ultron's absorption of Jarvis goes unnoticed as Rhodes bombs at comedy , Stark brags up his woman , Thor sends a pack of World War Two vets to the showers , the Captain discusses urban issues and Banner redefines the word awkward with Romanoff , all concluding with everyone proving they cannot properly handle Thor's hammer.

The fun and games end when Ultron now fully active crashes the party. In spite of his best sleepy hollow suit and witless rambling Ultron attempts to hand the Avengers their end.

This obviously does not happen and poof he's gone. With Loki's Scepter. Later in the replay lab , Thor nearly beheads Stark , but the Captain saves everything again even in the face of the prophecy Stark so eloquently illustrates for the viewing audience for later review in Avengers : Endgame. If they lose they will lose together , uh-huh.

Back in Sokovia the Maximoff's head to an abandoned church for some new age enlightenment. Returning to stryker's lab Ultron informs the Maximoffs he will be destroying the Avengers for which they are all in. So they go shopping , to a man who knows no fear , an arms dealer marked by Wakanda himself. Ultron Disarms the dealer and grabs hold of his vibranium for a tidy sum. The Avengers show up attempting to sour the deal and a discussion of values devolves into exchange after exchange. Wanda makes the whole situation a mind warp and sets the Hulk beserk. Stark stops the big green machine with help from space and a new technique in simultaneous land acquisition and demolition. Reeling from the arse kicking handed them they decide to soothe their wounds with a sleepover at Barton's house. With special guest Nick Fury. On the side Natasha and Banner get closer than ever And discuss his performance anxiety. Back in Korea Ultron is about to hatch his next evil plan but needs tech from Banner's lady doctor friend to pull it off. This creates yet another long expensive action sequence involving machines explosions and runaway trains and planes. Oh with one tiny exception the Maximoff's switch sides.

Thor gets a crash course in the infinity stones with Dr. Selvig and Stark introduces Banner to the reborn Jarvis. Together they have a new vision. Natasha in the meantime is back at Ultron's layer laying out 40 winks and waking to a nightmare. As Ultron describes his endgame , the Maximoff's join the Captain in stoping Stark and Banner from finishing the ultimate vision. After an explosive round of back and forth Thor arrives to put the hammer down , completing vision. After an intense self healing session , Vision and the Avengers take off to terminate Ultron. Upon arrival Ultron demonstrates his upgraded armor and lays out the drill. Evacuation of Sokovia proves difficult and success is up in the air. Ultron lays down his ultimatum he intends to drop the humans of earth like a rock. Most of the avengers assist in removing Ultron's army amidst , Barton's therapy sessions , hulk smashing and discussions of events in Budapest.battles and fights and clashes oh , my. Fury shows up with a flying carrier prototype and the general population hops on for a ride. Maximoff's Brother dies saving Barton and a kid from Ultron and Wanda takes the heart out of his efforts. The city now falling Stark and Thor tag team an electric death blow on the meteor , bringing its massive weight down to millions of more earth sized pieces.

Everyone wins and yet loses , and more people who clearly were not paying attention line up to put themselves in harms way as Avengers.

The Gravitas of this dud imploded on first impact.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I'm old school. Superheroes movies are supposed to be fun and the superheroes themselves should be morally upright. They should stand for that old cliche - truth, justice, and the.... well that covers it well enough.

We are already beginning to see the moral ambiguity of Captain America: Civil War. Stark is not a good person. The end justifies the means for him and. I question if there is any line he wouldn't cross. Most of the other Avengers are not quite as ambiguous, but they cover a spectrum from Captain America at the one end to Stark.

The movie itself is all about ruthless destruction which inevitably leads to massive cold-blooded deaths. A few of the deaths are heartbreaking to the viewer, but why aren't they all heartbreaking.

Governments in the Marvel universe now begin to see that the Avengers are often as dangerous to civilians as the villains they oppose.

Today's media entertainment is about action at the expense of everything else. And money is their only morality.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I find it very difficult to write review of superhero films. The reason for this is what are they really other than the cinematic version of a McDonald's meal? Quick and easy to produce, look good, fill you up, but ultimately do very little that's good for you. Only you don't realise this and then repeat the experience, hoping next time will be better.

This was fine, it passes the time. It's got all the bells and whistles you've come to expect from a Marvel film, and this one has the ever likable Mark Ruffolo involved, so that elevates this slightly.

It's not good though. It's fluff, utterly forgettable fluff. I wish the whole genre would disappear quickly.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I remember the trailer for 'Age of Ultron' so well. This movie had such incredible potential. The preview portends world-shattering cataclysm, a foe so great that the Avengers are brought to their knees and forever changed. Even still, the music sends chills down my spine.

But I also watch that trailer now and I'm just angry. Because AoU wasted all its potential. We got a fun party scene, one cool moment near the end, and all we had to give in return was 2 hours of our lives that we'll never get back.

In the opening scene, we see a moment where time slows as the Avengers charge through the forest, and we see them all lined up, hard-boiled determination on their faces. We're supposed to cheer, ""Yeah! Heroes!"" I groaned.

Black Widow is reduced to a damsel in distress. A scene in which she opens up about her past may be an attempt to show her displaying some human vulnerability to her comrades, but instead it crosses a line into misogyny as she wails about how being rendered sterile makes her a monster.

Early trailers showed us Iron Man's Hulkbuster Armor, and promised the fight of the century, but it's over so quickly that it's terribly anticlimactic. I'd rather it not have been in the film at all than to have seen the potential wasted as it was.

The entire scene of Thor receiving his vision about Midgard is so out of place, disrupting the flow, that it, too, would have been better off cut from the movie.

Film adaptations often change details about one thing or another to better fit a character, place, or thing into the narrative as it's being spun. The Maximoff twins, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, see their identities altered from the comics; in 'Age of Ultron,' they are from the same small fictional country in Eastern Europe where key portions of the movie are set. I suppose there are worse alterations one could make, yet at the same time - especially seeing as the twins joined forces with the Nazi-linked HYDRA, while in the comics they are Jewish, the children of Magneto? This change feels like erasure.

The movie also had an opportunity to force big changes upon the Avengers. The trailer informed us in no uncertain terms of the possibility of someone dying. And, well, that's what we got - but it's Pietro Maximoff, a character that was just introduced and who we know nothing about, that gets axed. Missed opportunity much, Marvel?

These are the things that have stuck with me about 'Age of Ultron' after 6 years. Almost everything else about the movie was forgettable enough that it left no impression at all. Meeting Hawkeye's family as the Avengers retreat to their farm would have made his death all the more impactful, but no, you can't shuttle a major star from the franchise that quickly. Introducing Vision into the MCU didn't nearly feel like the ""eureka!"" moment it should have been. In 2015, 'Age of Ultron' should have been Marvel's biggest movie ever. Instead, it's almost certainly their weakest.

My enthusiasm for Marvel's cinematic endeavors effectively ended with the gross failure of 'Age of Ultron.' That's not to say that they can't still make good movies: 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a treasure; against all odds, 'Black Panther' is a genuinely fantastic film. But barring extraordinary exceptions, I just don't care any more. I still haven't seen the Thanos films, and I don't plan on it. If movie theaters ever open again, I don't particularly intend on shelling out cash for a Marvel movie. AoU could have been a movie to foster excitement for years to come; instead, it smothered what little I had left.

I said this elsewhere 5.5 years ago, and I still mean it: in hindsight, 'Age of Ultron' probably peaked with the New York Times review whose byline read, in part, ""None of this matters.""",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"a quarter of a billion dollars to make,almost 2.5hrs long....for this?

Story goes Stark & Banner try to make a program to protect mankind, but cant. but then while they are out having a drink it magically happens by itself (never explained how).. It then becomes self aware (like Skynet) & decides to wipe out humanity (again never explained why) & goes to live in the internet (maybe while there it watched Thor or two girls one cup & decided to end us), magically making armies of Iron men-a-likes from who knows where (again no one explains why there's iron man factories all over the world to borrow). He keeps turning up now & then & the avengers keep killing them & him. though the avengers also destroy pretty much all the buildings in the various cities they turn up in (bit like team America) but also spend all their time trying to save all the humans in said cities as well (which becomes unintentionally hilarious considering the destruction the Avengers cause) well, that's the story....if you think that'll keep you engaged for nearly 2.5hrs you might enjoy it. the computer graphic effects are generally very good , 3D isn't great.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Okay . . . I must say that I could not stay and watch after the first 30 minutes of the movie . . . I, literally, started to ""drift off"" at least twice. I finally asked my sister if she was as bored with it as I was and she said that she had started to doze herself . . . and this is at a Matinée!! And . . . it was in 3D!!!

I did ask a couple of other people about it and they said that they had enjoyed it . . . I don't know if it gets any better . . . The people I talked to were guys . . . and they liked the fight scenes, which were good. I am just not that ""into fight scenes"" I need SUBSTANCE, story line.

So I am going to try and watch it again and see if it gets any better.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The tile says it all, I lost 135 minutes of my life watching the most insipid, boring, shallow, awful, film ... it is at part with TITANIC in the worst 100 films I saw in my life. The theme of Artificial intelligence has better been dealt in AI by Steven Spielberg and a very nice English film ""Ex-Machina"" by Alex Garland. Let us not speak of the acting capabilities of the actors.... Sack of potatoes, apples or carrots would have been better. As for directing it is non-existent , even the battle scenes are poorly executed the scenario was written by some alien from Mars (now that they have discovered water)directed to ignorant, dispossessed from any analytical skills human beings and let us talk about diversity.... hahahahahhahahahahaha, no LGBT , no native Americans, no Spanish, No Indians , no Arabs .....Finally, let us put aside the clichés... the best collection in a film",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Its boring. Joss Whedon is a talented writer and director, but he did a bad job on the first Avengers movie, and with this one he managed to do worse. All the characters are flat, nothing happens inside of the characters's heads, zero thoughts or emotions, its obvious that it's just actors giving a performance. The story is inconsequential, plot points appear without meaning or impact, they have to kill a character off just to create drama. Its a formulaic movie that really only works for 8 to 10 year old kids-- On a side note I find it amusing that most of the fans of this and other superhero movies, have not read the comics and probably never will.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"So, Age of Ultron. It's definitely an Avengers movie, but not actually DIFFERENT from the first Avengers movie. Sure there's robots instead of aliens, Ultron instead of Loki, but in reality, the only thing that makes it different is... well the robots! To me, I think that it is a bad remake of the first movie, a blockbuster purely to gain the same amount of money Avengers did. To me, the silver lining(and what earned this 2 stars) is seeing Ulysses get his arm cut off!(Sorry Andy Serkis!) Also, one good thing about the plot is Vision. He's been my favorite character for awhile, and adds a lot of momentum to the plot.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"All these great characters the best visual effects, but such a boring story, we go from action to half hour of nothing far to often. Yawn",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,The charcters have no clear motives. Ultron bad cgi,2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Age of Ultron is an extremely well executed comic-movie; This movie basically picks up where the first Avengers movie left off. If you haven't seen any of the solo Avengers movies you shall not worry because, you don't really need to have or know anything about what happened during the solo movies.

The chemistry amongst the characters is fantastic. All of the avengers know each other and they work together extremely well.

The movie also has character moments and each of the characters in this movie have their own movies to shine.

Ultron is effective but in the end dull. Ultron has some good moments, his purpose and intentions are clear but, in the end Ultron is just easily disposed off like every other villain (what hare you really surprised).

I thought the action scenes where very boring. I've seen the Avengers fight together before; this time there are no real stakes and the action movies in a fast pace.

This movie just really sets up Infinity Wars (I will except that for a comic-book movie.

In the end, I had fun with Avengers: Age of Ultron. All of the characters where fun but, the action scenes where boring. Every character in the movie had their moment to shine but in the end, I feel like Ultron got the short end of the stick (Ultron was perfectly executed throughout the movie though.

Watch this movie if you love fun comic-book Avengers adventure, however, if you don't then watch The Dark Knight for some really serious drama. Avengers: Age of Ultron is fine and effective.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"After seeing the first ""Avengers"" movie in 2012, I was wondering how they were going to top it with the sequel. Then in 2013, the first teaser trailer came out for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". I thought, ""okay, 'Age of Ultron' is kind of a weak and stupid title, but I won't let it ruin the movie. Who is Ultron?"" I said to myself. I then looked up the character, and I was blown away. Ultron has several cool powers and abilities, and he is indestructible. ""Wow!"" I thought: ""how will the Avengers stop him?!"" Then, I watched the teaser, and the first two official trailers. They were laid out just as I thought, with an ominous tone, and a dramatic soundtrack. The first few trailers were great, it got me excited and hyped to the max for this film. Then came the final trailer, and at that point I slowly began to realize what we were in store for. The music wasn't very dramatic, and it just felt more like a day time television commercial. I thought: ""okay, this trailer is different. Where is the dramatic and ominous tone?"" But, I didn't care, I was still going to see this movie regardless. Boy did I make a mistake! This ""movie"" is stuffed past the brim with one-liners, comedic moments, it hardly followed the original comic book stories, and at no point did I feel any tension whatsoever. I've seen many disappointing films, and this ""movie"" certainly belongs in my ""Top 10 Most Disappointing Movies"" list. I knew before I first saw the film that they changed the original story. In this ""movie"", Hank Pym doesn't create Ultron, Stark does instead. That does not follow the original story. Now of course, some movies can get away with altering the story, but that does not work in this ""movie"". However, Tony Stark does create Vision, that is comic book accurate. That's the only thing they got right in this ""movie"". But as far as Ultron goes, I could not believe how they portrayed Ultron in this ""film"". Ultron is a wuss in this ""movie"", he is practically the polar opposite of his real comic book self. He's supposed to be a cold, calculating, mindless robot. So, why does he have facial features? That moving mouth especially perplexes me, it makes him look more like an alien in a suit of armor. WHY DOES HIS MOUTH MOVE?! Sorry for repeating that question, it's just so retarded. His real character in the comics just has a red light on his face that glows when he speaks. That would've been so much better, because we, as an audience would not be able to tell what he's feeling. In that case, you wouldn't know when he was about to strike! That would have actually brought forth some level of tension for the ""film"". Another thing, when Ultron says: ""I can't physically throw up in my mouth."" (HE MUST BE THINKING ABOUT THE MOVIE ITSELF). That ""joke"" would've actually made sense if he had the glowing red light when he talks instead of that retarded moving mouth. The light would have further clarified that he does not have a mouth, and therefore he cannot throw up. That would have made the joke work, and it would have been funny! Although to be honest, just thinking about this ""movie"" makes me want to throw up. Also, Ultron has next to none of his actual comic book powers, and I was looking forward to see how those awesome powers would be utilized in this ""movie"". But no, we just get a watered down tin foil looking ""thing"". Granted, James Spader is a good choice for the voice of Ultron. What a wasted opportunity! Another thing, the plethora of one-liners in this ""film"" are abysmal, there are so many that it almost doesn't feel real. You know, you'd think after ""Batman & Robin"" (1997) contaminated the Earth with its existence, film studio producers and writers would have learned their lesson! Now, the first ""Avengers"" movie had one-liners too, but there were not nearly as many. It had the right balance between action, comedy, and drama. Unlike the sequel, the one-liners in the first Avengers film are actually funny, but in ""Age of Ultron"" they're not! Also, the acting is all over the place in this ""movie"", some good, some okay, and some bad. The soundtrack is generic, nothing special or original at all. The sets and locations are boring. Sadly, the only good thing in this ""movie"" are the special effects, and that's not saying much. Special effects are usually a given in movies since the mid 19th century. I think that the biggest reason this is my least favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe film is because the movie had so much hype and build-up for over a year, and then it amounted to nothing. Out of all 20 plus movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this one, by far, emotes the most anger out of me. I give it 1 out of 5 stars, which of course equates to 2 out of 10 stars on the IMDB scale. On a final note, in the ""movie"" I wanted to hear one of the main characters say: ""Avengers, assemble!"" Sure it's corny, I know. But, I think it should be warranted in one of these movies. Captain America almost says at the end, but then the end credits cut him off. I was furious! Also, for a title called ""Age"" of Ultron, we didn't even find out how old Ultron was. Yes, that's a joke, I thought that I'd end my scathing review of this ""film"" on a positive, humorous note. The ""age"" of events in this movie take place in just a few days. Whereas an ""age"" can range from a year or longer, so the title doesn't make any sense! Nothing in this ""movie"" makes sense. Stay away from this ""movie"", watch the first ""Avengers"", or ""Avengers: Infinity War"" instead!",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"So the sequel has good action , special effects and bad bad story writing. The movie wasn't satisfied enough like the previous one.

The concept of ultron was good but development was too poor. Most of the time i don't understand if ultron is a robot or alien. Seems like they just want to make sequel for making money thats why they released the movie in India first.

Because i am sure they face greater loss if movie release on USA.

Overall movie is watchable but only watchable because it doesn't have something new .

And movie deserve the rating 6 out of 10.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Despite the expensive special effects and excellent actors, I believe this one will be remembered as a B-movie in the near future. I was wondering why I heard no one commenting on how awesome the new Avengers movie was, but I decided to see it anyway. I think the only Marvel movies that are worse are X-Men 3 (the one with Phoenix) and maybe the Ang-Lee-directed Hulk.

All superhero stories (in fact, most stories) follow the same basic pattern: the good guys need to stop the villain who wants to destroy the city or the world. What sets them apart is the depth and likability of the characters, the consistency of the plot, the quality of the dialogue.

In the Thor (and Iron Man) movies, you have intelligent heroes with a lot of power, but too much pride and hubris. They get set back because of their arrogance, but they are always compelling and inspire sympathy.

In this turkey, all the heroes are one-dimensional with no defining personality. I felt like the actors were tired of playing the same role (understandable) but they wanted to rake in more millions of dollars (who wouldn't). Even so, the movie could've been saved by a good script, but the dialogue was the worst part. Every sentence was a cliché, every joke a forced, unfunny one- liner. You can't explain this away by blaming it on the fact that it's a Disney movie, because this installment actually has more sexual innuendo than any other.

The one saving grace, though, was the cameo of the actress from Freaks and Geeks. She gave a heartfelt performance, but didn't have good dialogue to work with. Still, for her I raise my rating to a 2. The Olsen sister was fine, but why not hire a Russian actress? Is it so critical to have a famous name that they can't get an authentic Russian accent?

Actually, even worse than the dialogue, the worst part was the villain Ultron. If you think about it, the name is pretty stupid, and subconsciously, I think this kept me from seeing the movie for a while. From the title ""Age of Ultron"" I thought he was going to be a supervillain on par with Apocalypse. I thought he was going to take over the world and have some kind of dystopian world government which the Avengers would infiltrate. Instead, he's this goofy robot that sounds like a badguy from a Western. He's not threatening, just cartoonish, and personally I cringed or laughed every time he came on screen. I feel about him, in many ways, the same way I feel about Nuclear Man from Superman IV.

In fact, there is another parallel with Superman IV. (I'm thinking of the space scene in that movie.) Ultron brings up the floating island in order to crash it down. When it's falling, you see the fire of the atmosphere burning it on reentry. But it was never burning when it was going up! So there's that inconsistency, but also, wouldn't the vacuum of space and the heat of the atmosphere have killed the heroes who weren't wearing suits?

Frankly, I feel this movie insults the intelligence of the audience and demeans the actors. I don't think we're the ones that should be blamed for watching these movies, it's the people who write these scripts. Only from a TV movie might one expect such an illiterate, rushed script. I don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing the movie, but you'll thank me if you see it without paying for it as an MST3K-style comedy.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The movie started out with a very theatrical action scene with all of the heroes jumping, rolling, shooting, ""hulking"", and cheesy one- liners. Kind of fun, but mostly made me want to throw up from all the camera movement and jumping around. Don't know why they were there fighting, they just showed up to blow things up I guess.

Either way, the plot was weak, another ""Humans are a disease that must be cleansed"" type of script. Thanks, already saw Independence Day and Will Smith crushed it. Then, they forced a love story out of no where with Hulk and Romanov. The run on joke about Cpt. America and his ""not-so-potty"" mouth was terrible. The new girl, the only cool Olsen sister, had a crazy amount of power but never used it. Just shot red stuff every once in a while. The only good part of the movie was James Spaders' voice. It was chilling and dark, but an AI that had an irrational personality trait, that's bogus.

The movie sucks. It's a complete waste of time.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"OK

I bought a 3d TV JUST because I wanted to watch The Avengers at home. I watched it so many times - the bluray became blurry! This was after having watched it three times with different people in the cinema!

Fast forward with pee-holding excitement to Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. How can I summarise this without boring you with a shopping list? Basically: Everything right about the first Avengers - was MISSING in this one. As promised - I'll stop complaining there.

LOVED Paul Bettany though. He was superb as always in whatever he appears in! As was - surprisingly - Elizabeth Olsen (and I thought she'd be terrible - but she was actually excellent. All fragile, deadly, heartfelt, deep, angst-ridden, quiet rage and fear).

Overall? Put the soul back into the next one please. Missing the character development and warmth of a Whedon picture. Oh yeah - and please bring back Loki. Thanks X",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The avengers: age of ultron is one of the laziest, most uncreative, lackluster and poorly thought-out sequels to ever exist. The fact that this film got such positive reviews and many defenders of it astounds me. Just like its original predecessor, this movie is almost plot less. It has the most basic plot that you can imagine. The kind of plot that the likes of Michael Bay uses in his transformers movies. Just a sarcastic robot who wants to destroy humanity for vague reasons. (Once again, another awful MCU villain, but then again, its no surprise) And is also bastardized in the movie and treated as a joke.

The avengers team could not be more bland and uninspiring in this movie. Not as bland as the first one, but close. Ironically, the most human character out of them all was vision, and that partially is due to a solid performance from Paul Bettany, not the writing. The other characters are extremely dull. Black widow, Thor, Cap, Bruce and all are extremely boring who lack heart and depth. Especially captain America. Which is a shame, considering he is the leader of the group and is supposed to be inspiring.

The film is also poorly choreographed and shot. The film making felt incredibly amateurish for a supposed professional director. The action sequences were laughably atrocious, albeit entertaining. Some scenes were incredibly horrendous, that they felt like a video game sequence. In fact, video game cut scenes make a better movie than this. There were many scenes that felt forced and its only purpose is to just advertise upcoming movies (some that won't even happen).

And just like its predecessor, the movie lacks any kind of heart and emotion. This is because it only wants to focus on dull humor and mindless, poorly constructed action scenes. Instead of having actual good writing that develop the characters as human beings, they are just mindlessly working together and banter with each other. Why even bother with making the cabin scene if they don't eventually evolve?

Now some may think I am taking this way too seriously, since some people say this movie is JUST for fun. But if the comics had so much heart, creativity and soul, why the film can't have that? Oh yeah because the MCU needs safe choices in order to have guaranteed success. No need to have challenging themes or artistic merit, only soulless action garbage to keep you busy for a couple of hours.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Just what you could expect. A tiresomely frenetic, needlessly violent and mindless yawn of an actioner with cardboard characters, endless overdone special effects and a $29.95 script.

The storyline was moronic and the acting sucked. Robert Downey, Jr. was particularly lame, a master of two on-screen emotions.

Because I was working this event, I got to sit through it twice in one day. In 3-D. Once would have been more than enough.

No wonder these big-budget, so-called ""blockbusters"" are such box office bombs these days. They bite it big time the first time or two out as a franchise, and then become even more ridiculous and unwatchable as new installments are puked out. What kind of morons bankroll this type of crap? Really?",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The assembled Avengers cinematic universe, as well as each character's standalone film(s) is intended as an homage to a long standing property, fore fronting entertainment and nostalgia above substance and development. That is not detrimental by any means, some of the best products of entertainment have followed the same formula and found incredible and justified success. What Whedon has done with both of the assembled outings though did not qualify in this category at all. I am aware that he has achieved that untouchable-nerdy godlike status that allows him the ""creative"" liberties to now assemble juggernaut films like Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron, where the eye-candy mind-numbing loud-chaos inter-cut with snide comments, punchlines and one-liners aiming at posterity are force fed on audiences. Considering then that we're not expected to be watching a film with the narrative complexity that Nolan has granted Batman trilogy, we wouldn't have expected such thin, lazy and pedestrian treatment. The characters that previously were given little to no room to develop are now treated to clichéd and forced subplots, the setup and motivations are as tired and laughable as it goes and the required comedic relief is so forced and bland that it is widely cringing. Even so, Whedon somehow manages to go through the motions requiring an almost impossible sense of suspension of disbelief, even for comic book standards and plot holes you could walk an elephant through.

All his might seem a contradictory coming from a self-proclaimed summer blockbuster superhero film fan. It might even seem more contradictory review coming from a huge X-Men, a fan that manages to somehow find redeeming qualities and saving graces in the weakest entries (and there are nine of them). The case with The Avengers franchise though is that an already overcrowded ensemble unites for sequels upon sequels, not to mention their own parallel trilogies that also include mini reunions of sorts, with absolutely no originality or saving grace other than the massive wide spectacle of worldwide destruction. Call it cynicism, call it incoherence. I call it overgrowing exhaustion with this franchise.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I really loved the first Avengers. So much that I watched twice in the theaters. It was exciting and fully of suspense and funny and innovative. Nothing had been done like it before. The action was great and Sam Jackson added an element of bas-ass-ness to the entire thing. Boy was I looking forward to part 2. The fact it was being directed by the same person was a plus plus! So we get to the theatre, sit down full of anticipation, bursting at the seams with excitement just to experience a snooze fest.

The movie begins with the Avengers fighting villains in a wintery forest. Thor using his hammer and iron man using his suit and captain America using his shield etc. nothing new here peoplekeep it moving. Then the red head is able to sooth the hulk and turn him into Bruce banner by whispering some words to him. Wait a sec I thought the hulk was inconsolable.

The Scarlett witch and quicksilver added absolutely nothing to the movie. The Olsen girl has no personality and is wooden on screen and the only thing the Johnson guy has going for him is his body which was covered up by his horrible costume.

So they tried to introduce something new to the movie by creating a love thing between black widow and hulk and all of a sudden hawk eye has a wife and kids? Sorry but I'm not buying it. BORING! By this point the action seemed pointless and boring. Nothing new here so keep it moving. No even the addition of that new character could have pulled me into this drivel.

I won't even comment on the Ultron character. Strutting around like drunk poet. Absolutely no more super hero movies for me.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I'm all my life I have never watched a movie that captures my attention as much as what The Avengers age of Ultron has done. It's a science fiction movie with different characters , all of which have different personalities. It's the perfect movie to watch with the whole family. Being a boy mom, I found this movie quite the catch, it had my child's attention captured the whole time and that is a win for me. The picture quality as well as the sound system is very good. Thumbs up to the directors, crew and all characters that played this movie. It's all well executed, good job. I would recommend this movie.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Could not watch to the end, I'm too old (not 12 years old, when I would of loved this and give full 10) and the reason is (although I know this is a comic book movie with nothing to do with reality) the scenes were not done properly. CGI was all over the place, animation sucked, and there were no real life stunts whatsoever.

Again, as I said, I don't like this because of my age. Still huge fan of comics whenever I get to enjoy any. I hope this was released 50 years ago when I was a kid. Why it wasn't better, actors are top actors, dialog was not bad at all? Ask the Marvel bosses, why ruin a film like this?",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,This movie was very underwelming i own it but only because it came with the first one i got for 8 dollars new and since i collect movies i bought them but i really dont care for this movie its sad that it doesnt even come close to first one.,3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Starts of really boring and stays boring till the end. Special effects quality is horrible in some scenes, it's comical, like the scene where Thor trying to save the gal from falling down the bridge. The connection between the character doesn't feel genuine and the dialogue still hasn't improved. Though the moral conflict in this movie is so much better than any of the other it's still boring to watch.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"No more, please. The last 'Avendure' installment was enough of a stretch...this one is completely beyond pointless. I will say that Ironman and certain other crew members are outstanding individually, but group-violence against multi-mega villains, is certainly getting ridiculous and old. A lack of storyline is my biggest gripe. It seems to have become the weakest links in movie now-a- days. People and things keep popping in and out of nowhere, with no reason. Granted, if watching movies similar to this one, defines your life, than maybe you can explain the reason and origins of the twins. I personally don't care, but some people really need to know. What I say to those in such sheltered existences is, 'yippee for you, now get a life and please don't vote - reality is way out of your mind's grasp'. I personally don't care what poignant action took place in the last episode I suffered through, I am just proud I made it through the stupid thing. What I gather from the dialogue at the end, this should be the very last one with the old gang in it. I guess there is a new group, ready and eager to usher in new flops...but gone will be 'Ironman, Hulk, Arrow...and others. Good idea...should have done it earlier. But can't pass-up a payday I guess. No more, please",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"That was unaware of this movies existence? I waited eagerly for the avengers sequel and i was never aware of the existence of this film until 2018. That being said its awful, and i missed out on nothing.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Possibly the worst movie choice I made in a while - I thought "" I liked Iron Man "" but truth be told this movie was all over the place.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The Cons= before I begin I just want to say that I Personally don't think that this Film is Copmelet Trash or anything like that, as I Feel that Age Of Ultron does have its moments it's just that I also Personally Feel that a Couple of it's Negatives or Cons Really Drags The Film Down. To the Point where I Really don't want to watch it given the choice despite of what I've just said. And one if not The Thing that Drags this Film down was that I just Personally Feel that Ultron just Talks way too much. Mostly about talking about How Everyone is a Puppet on a String and how His Strings are Cut. To the Point where it just becomes Annoying to Me Personally. I'll even go as far as to say that it just Feels that James Spader was demanding more lines during the filming of this film, I Really Hope that's not the case.

And that's not the only thing it also just Feel that he even talks when it wasn't Necessary for his Character to Talk. Then there is his Big Plan through out the Film it was just Forgettable to me and the way he was Defeated just Felt Lackluster to say the least. Moving on to the Next Jarring thing Drags the Film Down for me is Aaron Taylor Johnson's Version of Pietro Maximoff aka Quicksilver. And his Idiotic Line of ""What You Didn't See That Coming?"" Not Only it's Idiotic but also Makes Him Sound Arrogant. Which is why I Personally Prefer Evan Peters aka The Former Fox Version of Quicksilver From The X Men Films, as Evan Peters Version was the Very Opposite of Aaron Taylor Johnson's Version. As Unlike with the MCU Aaron Taylor Johnson's Version I Feel that Evan Peters. Is Much More Likable and Charismatic and so Much More to Watch on Screen.

Which is why I could easily compare Evan Peter's Version to the DC's The Flash and imagine those two version interacting with one another. Not So Much with Aaron Taylor Johnson's MCU Version. Anyways Moving on the Next thing that I think that Sort of Drags the Film down was the Opening Scene, as it has no context, and without context that Opening Scene is just an Action Scene to me. It be like having The Second Iron Man Movie without the Context of Having the Press Conference from the ending of the first film and, Ivan Vanko's father telling his son that should be him. That his Son should be on TV and Giving Press Conferences and Making Iron Suits and all, and Not Tony Stark. It's Basically the Action Movie's Version of a Horror Movie Starting Out with a Kill By the Supernatural Killer of the IP. Moving On again I just don't like the Idea of Bruce Manner Moving On So Easly From his Girlfriend or at least Crush Petty Ross so easily and quickly. And as for the ending Scene I just didn't like especially how Captain America's Line of ""Avengers Assemble"" was Cut Off Abruptly. Especially when there's No Reason to. And that should do it for the Cons.

The Pros= As I've said this Film does have its moments it's just that my Cons Really Drags them down for me. And the First One Being is that I Just Loved the Hulkbuster Verses the Incredible Hulk Fight, so much in fact that I Personally Consider it My Favorite Part of the Film. The Only Personal downside for me Personally is that it just Felt Way Too Short and Cut Off. And I just enjoyed the Quick Rundown of Natasha Romanoff's Backstory. I also thought that the way how Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch Burst Out of that Church was Really BA of her. And All of The Foreshadowing for Future MCU Films that Came Out After was Not Only Neat but I Really Loved how they where Fit in to the Story Perfectly. But what's even Better is that They Actually Used All of those Foreshadowing in Future MCU Films and not just left them Unresolved, or altered in anyway. Making all of the Foreshadowing just Throw away things I really Applaud the Powers that Be for that.

And I also like how Tony's and Steve's Rivalry didn't just end in the first film no instead it continued in this film, by having another argument. The only Downside from that is that it just all felt so empty. As I Personally Feel that they could've used this Argument as the Next Step to their eventually Fought in Captain America Civil War Film. But that's whole other Matter entirely all together. I also Enjoyed the Casual Interactions Between Bruce Banner and Natasha those where Nice to watch. And Sure Ultron Maybe Annoying and Never Shouts Up, But I do Admit I do like his Design aside from his Eyes which Looks and Feels So Cartoony to me. And that should do it for the Pros.

Final Thoughts= And Remember this is just my Opinions yours Could be Deferent. And that should do it for now.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,I went with my friends to the cinema and it was a big let down after the first avangers,3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This film is a mess of convoluted narratives, uncoordinated action, & protracted character development for far too many characters.

A film should tell one story. But amongst all the technological prattle we have several story details which breaks up the movie into sections which no one single audience bracket can appreciate.

This film has all the aspects I hate in bad writing. An enemy you can't see, an enemy with psychic powers (Batman & Robin pheromone dust?) which breaks up the film's momentum, flashbacks, good guys fighting each other, taking the heroes weapons away, the forced love affair, meeting the cool guy's pregnant wife & kids, girl power, a villain that keeps regenerating, & a new hero that overshadows the rest.

The action is so disconnected. Take the fight with Thor at the end. They start fighting, you want to see this fight AND.... Cut to another scene. It takes about 4 minutes during the finalé to come back to this scene. And the Hulk you forget is there! The first avengers were all working together, & you got a real sense of timely continuity during the battle.

You want to see the heroes face a new enemy, gear up with new tools, & show this bad guy who's boss! That's what the story needed to be! But you're hardly rooting for them to save the day at the end because apart from the fact you're so bored by then, you've lost all belief in them. They squabble all the way through, they let mere memories defeat them, & you never feel a desire for these cookie cutter robots to get destroyed by them. It's like those droids from the Star Wars Prequels all over.

The Avengers were assembled to protect mankind. This worked in the first film. In this film? Humanity just gets in the way of their CGI Battles. They ppss everyone off, destroy everything, not a peep out of the government, & kill all the robots that they themselves were responsible for creating.. Yay.. erm.. Hooray? What a mess this film is.

Creativity needs freedom. I guess the writer was stifled were creativity was concerned.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"It boggles the mind to think that today's Military Entertainment Complex has but ONE approach- the militarization of movies, with cheesy cgi thrown in for ""good measure."" Today's movies have come to resemble little more than the video games that preceded them; that movies like AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON are based on COMIC BOOKS boggles the mind: with characters long established and story lines quite literally laid out in easy-to-follow ""storyboards,"" the apparent inability of Hollywood's ""brightest"" to cobble together anything of movie-going value is puzzling, indeed. What more do they need...? (A lifelong love of Storytelling wouldn't hurt, nor would an affinity for the Comics upon which these Big Budget Bombs are based, but the Hollywood ""elite"" seem uninterested in what has come before and clichés are heaped on clichés with all the finesse and depth of a television commercial...) A big budget doesn't necessarily denote quality.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"It's as entertaining as holiday fireworks: initially exciting, which fades; then just loud, and finally the sense of time wasted because everything you just watched was pretty, but utterly meaningless.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Just mindless CGI action, long lenght and that's about it.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This movie was flat out boring and kinda stupid. It was just bad, so bad in fact, I felt embarrassed to be in the theater. The fighting in these movies has worn very thin. It's terrible stylistically. There's no artfulness to what is going on, it's just half second cuts of different characters punching the same bad guy (ultron clones) over and over again. As to the story, there was no story. There is a bad robot, it wants to make itself super powerful, but in the end, the good guys win. I don't know what the point of it all was. Are they trying to say something through a psychobabbling evil robot? Is there some reason in the overarching universe of comics for all of this to be happening? Not that I could tell. Again, a bad robot came, it fought the avengers, the avengers won, hooray.

Seriously, save your money, unless you were born yesterday...",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"A very loose story bound together only for the love of special effects action. The fight between Hulk and Iron man is the highlight of the movie. The climax fight goes for a good 20 minutes or so, it begins to feel like when will it end. Everybody is given lines that are meant to be very philosophical, but end up turning meaningless. The key villain is finally killed by the power of three Vision, Iron man and Thor, but wait no he is alive again in next scene, just to be killed again by a new avenger. There is a point in the movie when one of the character says ""I am out of words"" after blabbering for a minute, that sums up my feelings for the movie. If you just want action watch your favorite action movie, don't waste time on this soulless flick.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the official start to the summer blockbuster season. And what a start it is. Undoubtedly one of the most hyped movies of the year, it had a lot to deliver, especially after the amazing trailer we saw and all the awesome footage, we were in for a treat.

Or at least we hoped so. Or at least I hoped so.

Well, from the rating I gave it, you would probably think that I certainly enjoyed it. And I really did, actually, I had a lot of fun with it. But fun is not the only thing I look for in a movie. A movie can be fun in a lot of different ways. This movie did it with its great and vivid action scenes, the dynamic CGI, the snarky and smart dialog, and a compelling although rushed villain.

But other than that, I felt something was missing. The first Avengers benefited from a more organized story, the characters had more interaction, and there was more of a conflict, which fleshed the characters out even more (that and that every hero had his own movie) and of course our favorite villain, Loki. Although I gave the first Avengers the same rating, I do think Age of Ultron is a bit of a letdown.

There is not really a story with a lot of surprises, just a string of events that lead to another. This is not really something new in a Marvel movie. We always have the same pattern of a story. A villain that has an evil plan and needs to be stopped. This is not a problem as long as the movie keeps the viewer invested with other points. Here, the only thing it has going for other than seeing our heroes interact, is one action scene after another that all feel kind of the same. In fact, the action is so bloated and loud, that it was exhausting and boring after a while. Ultrons robot army was just not exciting as a menace at all, they felt weak and useless and not like a threat to the Avengers. The love story between Black Widow and Bruce Banner was something that felt way too forced and out of place. At some point people chuckled because the dialog felt like it was something out of a soap opera. I really hope they improve their character arcs in the following movies.

By now you probably have already seen the movie and made up your mind. As for me, I expected more of a darker and grounded movie that didn't need to feel like every other superhero movie we've seen before. The hype for these movies to me, is very questionable. I'm still looking forward what this series has to offer in the following years, just please, change the formula.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The avengers, now running on their own, have to face yet another threat, Ulton, who wants to wipe out the man kind. There is something about the avenger films that makes them boring. There are enough action scenes, and some nice and funny dialogs, but the whole thing is tiring. The individual movies of each character are good enough, but the heroes working together comes through quite ugly. I did like that they present us with some of the past lives of some of the characters, but in the end, I found it a little too complicates, with long monologues, little humour, not to mention the twins, an entirely different story from the ones in x men. Maybe the second part was better than the first part, that was a huge disappointment, but all in all, avenger number two failed in every way. Better have them as individuals.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This latest telling of the Avengers left me lacking any enthusiasm with the franchise. I didn't find any warmth, chemistry, fun, anticipated dread, fear, drama, comedy in this showing. The robot wasn't menacing and the extraneous B story dragged on too long and wasn't necessary. I really didn't need to know about the wife and kids. And with the hype surrounding the robot, it wasn't menacing in the clashing with the Avengers. The drones proved not as tough as it was lead on to be, they were more of pest in the grand scheme of things. Bigger sometimes, is not always better. After viewing this, there was no lasting memory once the film was over with, you just wanted to forget about what you saw.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This movie, sadly, falls victim of its own hype. i was soooooo wanting this movie to be a great sequel to the original Avengers, and it falls flat on its face.

Andy Serkis, plays a character, who says about 3 lines, and is in the movie for the best part of 90 seconds, his part should have been enlarged, or written out. The story felt cobbled together, as did the story telling, and for its part made no sense, ie. the finale is seriously flat, and how Ultron came about is explained in about 5 lines in a short scene, that again, could have built up more tension. There is a plethora of gags, ala ""buddy cop"" style, and i had to check i wasn't watching Lethal Weapon with Riggs and Murtagh instead! Luckily, the movie has some great eye candy, but its all sum, and no substance, the movie lasts for 2.5 hours, but in all that time the story was hurried along, with no depth. There isn't much character development with the new guys, and as to why Red Witch and Qicksilver are even there, makes no sense, and is explained poorly.

This movie is no better than say, Iron Man II, and that is feint praise indeed, the flick flatters to deceive the viewer from the off, and its true that the action is non stop, and hits the ground running, but the price paid for the constant tempo, is a lack of quality, that is sadly obvious, that the first movie had it in bucket loads.

If you're a youngster you will love this movie, if you a more mature, discerning fan of the genre, then you will be left wanting. Joss Wheddon was quoted as saying this was the hardest thing in his life to get over the line, believe me it shows.

Wait for the bluray, this is a big flop, from start to finish.

gutted.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The script was a major dog in this movie. Upon rewatching the film, it's clear these are different characters, not the same ones in the first. There's too much babble in this movie about topics only drugged out college kids and professors would discuss, not real people. It gets absolutely ridiculous after a while. Also, Marvel is hurting their movies having the superheroes be worried about every single innocent person. These heroes would be thanked in real life for their service, not chastised and condemned. Civilians condemn the Avengers for the lives of a few people dying in spite of the fact the villains were either trying to take over the entire world and kill a lot more or outright destroy it completely. It's ridiculous. The humans have no ability to control these superheroes either; they are Gods. They would answer to them, not the other way around. Like most babble from college types, it's just not grounded in reality, but more the result of ultra-privileged, sheltered lives and a lack of a willingness to understand how the average person operates.

The CGI model of Ultron was incredibly bad and made it hard to take him seriously. It was cartoonish, a total hack job. There's a reason they largely kept him out of the trailers. Not sure who was responsible for that, corporate hacks or whatever, but it really hurt the film.",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"There are several problems with this sequel that other people have already talked about. But I want to mention this particular problem that perhaps nobody pointed out. You changed the so-inspiring soundtrack from the first movie. If you compare the theme soundtracks of both the movies, you'll find them very different. I accept that you can't stay with one soundtrack forever. But, man, you don't change it so quickly either. The main soundtrack from the first Avengers movie is in the hearts of many people, including me, and I felt very disappointed when I waited for it in the entire movie but it never came. This may not seem to be a very rational reason but after all these movies succeed because they inspire and music plays an important role in creating inspiration. Please bring back the original soundtrack in the third movie!",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I had to get this out of my system, so why not in form of review.

First here goes rant.Screw you Hollywood and yours peace of garbage,streamlined movies for brats.

Now to more constructive review (although, bare in mind if you read mini-series Age of Ultron,I am talking about comics by the way, you are going to be utterly and I repeat utterly disappointed , so don't bother reading further).

First of off when will this going to end ? Serious scenes that should make you sad,mad,scared are turned into comedy.This is fashion that is carrying over from infamous movie for kids (Hobbit 3 I am looking at you).Marvel universe is much more than listening to ""smart cracked jokes"" (to be frank only joke they got right is with Thor's hammer).

Movie has huge problem with pacing, villain is lame (the lamest there it is), I mean how exactly is what you presented in this movie Ultron ?Actually why it's called Age of Ultron ? Was this some agenda to attract more audience like comic fans for example or what ?People who read comics know what I am talking about, it is one of the best mini-series ever created (some people will beg to differ but like I care ..) .

It get's worse when they present Scarlet Witch and her brother Quicksilver.They had introduced two characters that play major role in Marvel Universe and spit at them by giving them like 10 min worth footage ? Action scenes are what you would expect,it's only thing done right.I want write anymore, because with each line I am getting more mad, so I will wrap it with one paragraph.However, before that let me just say, that while first movie didn't live up to my acceptation, I liked it, even with all things they got wrong,as for this one,If I could I would ask manager of cinema to refund my ticket because I would be better of If I had wasted money on something else.

If you are casual, new generation, unaware of MU until first movie and you simply don't give a damn about whole Universe setting,pale attempt, joke of the Avengers movie, go for it, it's made for people just like you.If you fall under category under unaware but willing to dig deeper than I suggest you skip this movie and go for comics.And I don't need to mention rest of us furious , viewers who felt betrayed ,now do I ?",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This movie begins with a huge action sequence that involves all of the main hero characters. This sequence sees them blow up tanks and people as they attack an enemy base. Every three seconds, someone cracks something resembling a ---joke?----lest we forget that a real joke involves something done/said that was, in some way, funny. One-liner jokes require a proper timeline and space within a dramatic/satirical context for them to be effectively funny. They require acute direction/writing to generate genuine laughter from the audience. Instead, we get an unfunny ""line"", being recited by an unfunny person, to an audience that forces itself to laugh, because they think they are supposed to. How many silly unfunny one-liners can you jam into an over-played over-indulgent opening action sequence? Watch...Age of Ultron..(lol)....to find out! The downfall of this movie lies specifically on the director/writer. Who, for some reason, tried to cram an entire movies- worth of action and one-liners into the opening 3 minutes of a movie. The most salient problems in this movie are: it's not funny; it's totally over-indulgent; the characters lack cohesion etc. I pity the person who walks into this movie hoping for anything more than surface-level 3d effects.",3

Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I'll be quick on this review. it's funny how people on here give this movie 8 out of 10 stars or say it's the best super hero movie they have seen.The Avengers movie came out in 2012. This movie came out in 2015.This is the Same Exact Formula and Sequences from the First Avenger movie!! A bad guy appears or comes to Earth,he wants to destroy Earth, The Avengers find out about him, the Avengers fight him and lose the first fight,they then regroup and fight not just the bad guy but a bunch of faceless henchmen and they win, Hooray!! And then while you are eating your popcorn near brain dead , The Hulk fights one of the Avengers- Not the bad guy---and tears up something .It really shows people will pay to see anything and there are no more writers or story creators in Hollywood.I can't believe Captain America the Winter Soldier was better than this .",3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This film is a perfect example of what happens when you're more focused on cramming in references and lead-ups to future films rather than having a cohesive narrative.

The Avengers return to take on one of Tony Stark's mistakes: a defence technology gone rogue, taking control of his Iron Man suits and becoming sentient. That's essentially the plot. Also shoehorned in is foreshadowing and allusions to future films such as Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War and Thor: Ragnarok. Our heroes are caricatures of themselves here as very little character development is given for the majority of the film, save for a 'shock reveal' about Hawkeye.

We are also shown the most 'out-of-nowhere' romance between Black Widow and the Hulk, which really only exists for people to make fanfiction.

Ultron is shown less as an intimidating villain and more as a wise-cracking ass. Barely memorable and his evil plot was completely forgettable.

Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson make their debuts as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver respectively, but since Quicksilver was already done by Fox's X-Men, Taylor-Johnson's multi-movie contract was made kinda redundant.

The movie attempts to have character bonding scenes at the halfway point, but ultimately, it's just more foreshadowing. This film may have about as much depth as a kid's swimming pool but the visuals are certainly stunning. I think it was around this point where many people were succumbing to 'superhero fatigue', but it's definitely debatable.

A lackluster sequel to the first Avengers, and the resulting cause of Joss Whedon's departure from involvement in the MCU.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"(Flash Review)

If you want to mindlessly watch super heroes using their cool powers and battle evil and pulverize a city, then look no further. The crux of the plot felt like a weak way to generate a dramatic threat to the world. I had a few raised eyebrows as it unfolded. Tony Stark recklessly creates a program called Ultron to protect the world and fails to run quality assurance on the code. ZING. The program launches to life and immediately is out for no good. Now all the Avengers must chip in to help destroy it, while giving Tony Stark light grimaces. There's your plot. So this computer intelligence, Ultron, Stark whipped up that is malfunctioning wants to turn the world to metal and destroy all the humans. The CGI was quality and it was packed with action as well as amusing running jokes about the heft of Thor's hammer. Hire better script writers next time!",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"What were the writers on?!!! Drivel in gigantic, cinematography marshmallow form of noise mayhem, visual effects which quite frankly the popcorn was the highlight.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"After seeing end game and wasting three hours of my life, I came back to watch this movie to see if it was any better than endgame, and I can honestly say that at least this movie was actually good, A bit long, but actually good. The storyline was coherent and made sense, the villain was mediocre but way better than Thanos, and at least Marvel was trying at this point.

Having recently seen both endgame and Spider-Man far from home I no longer have hope that Marvel can pull through and be that company that created such great movies like Iron Man, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and even the original Thor. All of those movies were amazing, they were well written they were exciting and brought a sense of magic that is completely devoid and gone from these new movies. They may as well be made for TV movies, it's like Marvel has devolved back to the Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk TV series, which honestly and episode of that is better than Spider-Man far from home. Marvel has just become this pathetic, PC company that no longer cares about quality over quantity.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"As often with a famous franchise, there's good films and there's bad films. This one just isnt very good. The special effects are great, the acting is mostly good and the director had some fine ideas. Cinematography is good although obviously mostly CGI. Sound design is cool so why the bad score? All these things just can't make up for this boring convoluded yet extremely clichéd plot. It lacks the fun of the previous avengers films and the pacing could be better as well.

All in all, Its technically a great film, however, it's not a fun ride unless you turn your brain completely off - which should never be a demand for seeing a movie. It's a shame really; I love superhero films but some are good and some are just painfully overhyped by fanboys... and that's coming from a fanboy.

An appropiate score for this would be 4.3/10.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Visuals (like x2, cool x1)

Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The first Avengers film was not quite a good movie, but it was a marvel of narrative efficiency with Whedon job mostly reduced to keep as many balls rolling as he can while adding some grace notes in the sidelines (in some ways it was the high point of early Marvel aesthetics of combining a bland surface and undervalued quirk personalities to add some flavor to it, a formula they seem to have mostly abandon this past 2 years after deciding people enjoy those bland surfaces well enough). Age of Ultron is a good deal more ambitious which unfortunate is part of its limitations. The plot is more character based with Whedon putting a futile earnest effort to serve a dozen actors well and there's some genuine desire to dig into American exceptionalism (not always with success) and build things around its characters eminent loneliness. The final result is just a huge mess, it is both overlong and feels like at least half hour worth of connective scenes that needed to be there got cut. It has no sense of how to move from one big setpiece to the next. Plots that are important either seem to come out of nowhere or get dropped without resolution, for instance it is good to see Whedon actually trying to do something with Iron Man's past as an arms merchant but I can only assume a big scene between him and the twins end up on the cutting room floor and without the whole subplot goes nowhere (overall this ilm seem to equal givenhints of things of actually use them to add depth). The action is way too chaotic and this is such a comic book film it often confounds angsty melodrama for character work. There is way too much heroes fighting heroes scenes (that said the nerd inside me will never be against the 50 year honored Avengers tradition of Iron Man trying to take a short cut, Captain America getting all self-righteous about it, they coming to blows and Thor getting to settle it). The last act is very questionable politically, but it is good to get a Marvel film that at least puts some actual stakes into saving people over simple destroying things. I also enjoy how Whedon uses Hawkeye's guy with a bow and arrow number to ground the action even if his script gets to cute overexplaning what he is doing. If this felt under control it might have amount to something but as it stand it is the a lot of cliff notes that go nowhere.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Why all the men in this movie are wearing training suits?

Starting with Captain America, The twin guy, Stark, the archer, even Black Widow... What is in this, yeah, we see they are built, what about something more stylish and classy?

Movie was kind filler to the series, world ran out of bad guys so we got aliens. Aliens ran scared so now we have evil intellect came out of Loki scepter. What is next, evil puppies? Evil gold fishes?

I am disappointed. Too unrealistic movie even for fantasy one.

At first scenes we see Avengers fighting, we literally see fifty kilos woman, the Widow, turning a huge bike just landing her foot on the ground. Well I'll tell you I was sliding on snow and drop my foot to kill the speed of the sled, my bone immediately cracked on two.

Being superheroes doesn't make them invincible. Yeah, a little blood, a few scratches... Give me a break!

And give that archer guy some shirt, I'm sick watching his armpits!",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"It takes effort to make such a boring movie. The only thing that kept me from turning it off was my need to see who was worse, Mark Ruffalo or Chris Hemsworth - Ruffalo by a nose.

Only saving grace was Ray Reddington as the voice of Ultron.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"As most of you know The Avengers first movie got great feedback from critics and viewers alike. Sadly sequels have a bad reputation of spoiling franchises. And this, ladies and gentlemen is the perfect example of this (including Jurassic park sequels).

So yeah. Mr Badguy wants to destroy the world and a group of guys stop him from dropping a meteorite (or in this case, a town) from demolishing the world (sounds familiar? Ahem, previous movie, ahem, superman)

The once laughable Tony Stark becomes a laughing madman that laughs as the world ends.

I will give marvel 4 stars for effort(?) and AMAZING visuals.

I think the writers where like ""so what now"" ""eh, 12 year old kiddies need action so... MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON CGI/MAKEUP"". I think that four stars is a very appropriate rating for this film.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The movie overall was okay. Good plot and everything, it's just that whenever the guy (Vision, I think was his name) was asked the question of who he was, and he said ""I am I am"", that set me off guard, because that is one of God's many names. In the story of Moses, God states Himself as ""I am that I am"" and I feel that is extremely blasphemous to the Name of God because it was as if that guy was claiming to be God or putting Himself on God's pedestal. I don't think that was a good move on the producer's side. I mean, the movie was great until that part, it was humorous, dramatic, adventurous, but after that, all I could see was blasphemous. It would have been a lot better without comparing Vision to God, that was wrong.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I liked the first Avengers. It was fun, had a whole load of action and some good acting, a decent story and such forth. However, after watching Age of Ultron for the first time yesterday, I can safely say it's not as good. No. I'm not gonna hold this back to the end, actually. It isn't very good at all. Maybe that's why everyone's forgotten about?

Following on, sort of, from Captain America: Winter Soldier and the first Avengers, you're thrown straight into the action, where the Avengers duke it out with what remains of Hydra, to snatch the sceptre – you know, the one Loki used in the first film. Nonetheless, there isn't really much fighting back, and the Avengers easily take the sceptre after a relatively boring action sequence, which both goes on for too long and is so easy for the Avengers that it's not actually that easy to watch. It's not silly action. It's not very exciting, it's just watching the Avengers beating up some goons, in a repetitive manner. The underwhelming action along with a substandard script, flat acting and total lack of atmosphere or inventive cinematography makes for an uninspiring first 20 or so minutes.

However, the intro for the first Avengers film wasn't all that much better, so I guess it got better then?  Eventually, I guess.

Well, the script didn't change, for one thing. Filled with brilliant things ranging from rubbish one-liners (not fun, Scharzenegger one- liners, that is; just Tony Stark annoying one-liners) to bad comedy. The story, on the other hand, isn't anything special either. Actually, it's a bit crap. Stuff blows up, they have a party, then some annoying robot guy turns up. Then everything goes a bit pair- shaped, and — oh! Did I ever mention the twins? They suck ass. I mean, they properly suck ass. Portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen and good ol' Aaron Taylor Johnson (the stars of Godzilla!), are the twins who I didn't care about. Vaguely European, they put on terrible accents and act without any expression or personality whatsoever. Sure, they have pretty cool powers, but that doesn't mean they're good characters. They ruin the film, no less. They just complicate things and make the film longer than it needed to be. Furthermore, the girl, whatever her name is, she does this telepathic stuff. It doesn't lead to anything other than a stupid fight between Iron Man and Hulk, which I didn't care about. I was thinking for a lot it: ""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"" Tony Stark, that is.

The film's length is a big issue, actually. What little content they had, they decided to stretch it out to over 2 hours. Simply put, over 2 hours is too long for a super hero film. They're all about silly action and cool characters, not soppiness and too much talking. The length and lack of substantial content for it makes for dragging out of scenes that weren't that interesting anyway, and, frankly, a first hour that's a bit boring — reminded of Godzilla, anyone? In some ways, I think this film is worse than Godzilla. Wait! I was supposed to leave that till the end! Oh well. Anywho, there's also way too much linking to the Marvel universe, with the telepathic twin at fault again. I don't want Thor walking around saying stuff, whilst ripping his shirt off in Thor, so I definitely don't want it in Avengers. None of the side plots added anything. Especially Tony Stark and Hulk's stupid fight.

Back to the acting. Robert Downey Junior. Eh. Didn't have much of a script to work on. I think his Iron Man is wearing thin, though, anyway. Scarlett Johansonn. The same as ever. Chris Hemsworth. Not helped by the script at all, his Thor isn't a friend with bad jokes. For some reason they decided for him to get involved in them. Alright. I'm gonna stop now. There isn't a special performance anywhere in this, and though the cast is the victim of a substandard screenplay, they don't do a good job of making the most of what they've got, as most of the performances are bland and without any change for the better from past performances — though Chris Evans is decent as Captain America, as per usual.

I haven't actually said anything positive yet, really. Well, maybe it's not quite as bad as you might have interpreted so far. Sure, the first hour is, but as the film gets further the action and entertainment gets a lot better, and the plot kicks in as there's actually some great action, in an exciting climax. It's great fun, and the score kicks in as well, so there's finally some atmosphere. The last 50 minutes or so are good, actually, as all the pointless talking and soppiness has more or less ended, the film finally finds a faster pace. Nevertheless, it's not all that good, as you may have guessed.

Verdict:

Uninspired on every level, Avengers: Age of Ultron, until the 1:20 mark, is rubbish. The last 50 minutes are quite a lot better, though, with great action and excitement on display. Nonetheless, the flaws found all over the first hour 20 are still found in this portion of the film; ranging from a bad script, to an uninteresting story, ponderous acting and pointless branching to the wider Marvel universe — with the film's length far too long. It's not completely rubbish, but

Just stick with Avengers Assemble.

""In some ways, I think this film is worse than Godzilla.""

Avengers: Age of Ultron,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a 2015 superhero movie and the first sequel to the super successful ""The Avengers"". Joss Whedon directs again and he is also among the writing team. The cast includes all the familiar faces like Downey, Johansson, Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Jackson, Renner... but they added some okay names too like Elizabeth Olsen or Sam Taylor-Johnson. The latter 2 play enemies early on, but when they realize what Ultron has really in mind, they quickly change sites. The danger is Avenger-made this time as it's Stark (and Banner) who created this mess that endangers all civilization now. Their intentions may have been noble, but shame that Ultron is not really capable of making a difference between good and evil and between cause of and reaction to violence. So he quickly becomes the Avengers' biggest nightmare. I personally was a bit surprised that Fury did not really teach the two culprits a lesson for what they secretly did. Honestly, everybody except Iron Man who was the initiator would have gotten their fair share of confrontation and criticism.

As for the overall quality of this film, I was pretty disappointed I must admit. The film runs for over 2 hours and 20 minutes and while it did not drag too hard admittedly, it all felt so generic and uninspired. It's actually pretty difficult to say what was the weakest about this one. Maybe the constantly desperate attempts at funny one-liners that make even a great actor like SLJ look weak. Then again Nick Fury is definitely not his best role, just his most known perhaps. Or was it how weak the villain felt. They had such an extraordinary actor like James Spader at their disposal and he felt almost completely wasted. I really never felt as if Ultron was menacing enough that they needed everybody to take care of him. And that this would not be enough even. The references about the Avengers with their bond fighting Ultron who had many soldiers, but zero strings felt desperately rushed in to give the fight scenes some deeper meaning. It all felt pseudo and for the sake of it all to me. This was a very bloated movie for sure, delivering from the technical perspective, but only there. Slightly memorable scenes like Hawkeye's family stayed the exception. It was all very shallow and very superficial.

And what's even worse, the quantity-over-quality component is in danger of becoming even more crucial as they keep adding more and more characters to the franchise. The result is that forgettable new characters have zero impact almost (did you cry when Quicksilver died? I was closer to cringing to be honest) and the old ones are not showing anything new at all or if they do like the romance part between 2 Avengers here, then it feels somewhat unauthentic to be honest. Besides why is always Renner's character the one getting wounded? Because he's the only one not trained in close combat? Please. Another disappointing repetitive aspect and his joke on mind control did not change things for the better. Hell, even Stan Lee's cameo was nothing extraordinary this time and it felt for the sake of it all like the rest of the film. It was not a failure, but it was a movie where you could comfortably switch off your brain before the start as it won't challenge you whatsoever. Or have you care. And that's one of the worst statements you could make. I will soon see the new Thor movie and I hope they managed to step things up there again. And that they really improve with the upcoming Avengers film that will be released in 6 months or so. If they don't improve, then best would be to discontinue, which they obviously won't do as these films are hits financially as big as it gets. But that obviously doesn't mean their quality is convincing, let alone memorable. This one here is the best example for that. Don't watch.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The first time I saw this movie I really liked it but after a rewatch it's one of my least favorite Marvel movies, I just don't enjoy it.

The fight scenes and camera work are terrible, the movie has so many quick cuts and is so horrifically edited, and they did a really bad job with Quicksilver, he had like 25 minutes of screen time and then they just killed him.

The villain is absolutely terrifying and a top 10 MCU villain for sure, but this movie doesn't feel like a sequel, it doesn't feel like an Avengers movie, a sequel is supposed to continue the storyline of the first one but this film has nothing to do with it.

It's also not funny, there's like one moment where I laughed and why does it start in the middle of a fight scene?

They also didn't do a great job introducing Klaue, who will be important later on and there's no explanation for why Iron Man had time to build Ultron.

And I'm gonna give Avengers: Age of Ultron a D+",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Joss Whedon promised us a ""darker"" sequel; did he succeed? It would appear yes, but that isn't necessarily a good thing.

What made Age of Ultron a ""must see"" for most is the simple fact that it comprises of characters we've had to watch in separate films. It was just the thrill of seeing Iron Man and Thor, two stars of their own individual films, meet up once again! This was the selling point for the first Avengers, and clearly it has succeeded again. However this may have been ""milked"" as there were clearly some characters that were there just for the sake of it, without any real need or purpose to serve the plot. This could have been time better spent explaining the events that took place between Age of Ultron and the previous Marvel films. The performance of Paul Bettany and James Spader as their Vision and Ultron were absolutely amazing, but not enough to justify the excessive final battle scenes.

After the first Avengers, the individual character story lines about the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye seemed to compensate for the lack of character depth (seeing as the other Avengers all have their own movies). However, this I felt was again excessive. As a sequel, Age of Ultron avoids the (necessary) burden of having to spend the first half of a movie developing its characters. Without revealing too much, it seems that the movie jumps straight into the plot ""for the sake of it"", just because it can.

In summary : Good cameos, great additions to the cast, but poor development, cliché sideline stories and fight scenes that seem to have lost their charm. Not to mention unanswered questions between the two Avengers movies, as well as the other Phase 2 movies. And to make it matters worse, nothing more than a slightly anti-climatic mid-credit scene.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The first Avengers film was such a success. It contained one of the most momentous cinematic moments of all time - The Hulk's efficient destruction of the villain.. ""Puny god!"" Never before have I heard a cinema erupt in such cheers. Nor am I ever likely to hear since.

So the expectations on this edition were very high. But unfortunately this film shows how hard it is to write a script containing multiple superheroes and be fair to each one of them. Inevitably it comes down to having a good villain who can beat them all - and here lies the Achilles heel of the Avengers property. How to give them something worthy of winning against.

So how to create a worthy adversary without introducing an alien? Have the Avengers create their own villain. Well, almost.

Right from the first frame the film is definitely The Avengers with equal time given to all of Our Heroes. The story is strong, twisty and challenging. All good so far.

Then.. inject a super villain who has the power to mess with the Avengers' minds. Whoops.

By the second act, the film has degenerated into an unrecognizable series of dreams, flashbacks and flash forwards. Soon it becomes impossible to tell which one is which. You look around the darkened cinema, catching the eye of other equally confused viewers. Before long, it becomes apparent that almost everyone around you has whispered ""what the &*$# is going on?

Thankfully this film DOES eventually get back on the rails. By the third act, we're back in true Avengers territory and it all ends happily ever after in true Avengers style.

Stick in there. Make sure you watch right to the very end, well after the credits have rolled. There are a few moments where the film tries to emulate the first, but overall the Age of Ultron brings together the hobble of heroes we had in the first film and prepares it for greater things to come in following editions.

This edition of The Avengers certainly won't be the favorite of most. It's largely disjointed. Kind of like trying to watch eight different movies at the same time. It would have got an 8 - if it weren't for that 40 minutes in the middle wasted trying to work out what the heck was going on.

Barely a minute goes by without the cinemas' sub woofers getting a workout. This is The Avengers, after all.

Great classic Marvel stuff, right down to Stan Lee's cameo. But please.. in the next edition, let's get some new blood on the Directors' table if we need to do flashbacks or jump from one reality to the next.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The title says it all. This installment of marvel heroes must have been written by the Hulk... 1% brain and 99% brawn. Basically, if you saw the trailer, you do not need to see the movie. Its a basic action flick and the plot was clearly just a secondary thing thrown in to show off special effects and animation. I was never a fan of the Averngers or Iron Man but I could tolerate them because I love comics and fiction. The problem with this movie is that the AI is treated as dumb making the plot silly, while the Avengers waste half a movie mopping around because they cant get along. The dialog was OK but you need to be a hardcore fan of each character to not be bored to tears... I am not a huge fan and I really don't care for all the explosions and action unless there is a solid plot.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"The Avengers was well-balanced and fun. It was a well-written superhero buddy comedy. The action was over-the-top but worked to enhance the laughs. It didn't take itself too seriously, which was welcomed at the time. Since, we have had a 3rd Iron Man film that sucked all the fun out of the Tony Stark character. A 2nd Thor film that was actually quite exciting and full of surprises, especially compared to the first, which was like a romantic TV sitcom. And we've had not only one of the greatest sequels of all time, but also one of the best action films in over a decade, Captain America: The Winter Solider. So to write there was a lot of hype for Avengers 2 would be an obvious understatement.

Age of Ultron is so unbalanced in so many ways, it's hard to know where to begin. The film is successful in a few areas. It does a great job of making us fear what Ultron is capable of. While Loki was charming and mischievous, Ultron is frightening. What's disappointing is that in a film called Age of Ultron, Ultron is not given enough screen time. The best scene has the Avengers taking turns trying to pick up Thor's hammer. Unfortunately, this scene was already revealed in the trailers and the actual film doesn't offer anything better. The most interesting aspect of the film, visually, are haunting visions given to the characters thanks to Scarlet Witch. This causes Thor to go off on a side quest, which is much more mysterious and interesting than what we are left watching. It also causes the much anticipated Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene, which is played for laughs and is over much too quickly. It's all downhill from there.

Age of Ultron is at it's best when it's being horrific and when it's revealing it's heart, which in the film's biggest surprise, lies with Hawkeye. We are introduced to some new characters that we are never given much reason to care about. Other than Scarlet Witch giving the Avengers their visions, both her and Quicksilver seem like pointless, lazy additions that take up screen time that could have been better spent with the characters we paid to see. What's worse is the time wasted on an out-of-place and unfitting love story that develops between Black Widow and Bruce Banner. It's so forced and unnecessary, it actually causes us to loose interest in their characters. Hulk no longer has the impact he once made. Tony Stark has long lost what made him such an exciting character and this film doesn't do anything to make us excited to see him again. Hawkeye is the only one we are given reason to care whether he lives or dies. In the final act, we are introduced to yet another new character that is so poorly executed, it makes us glad this is the last Marvel film Joss Whedon will be directing.

In The Winter Solider, the intensity of the action scenes was taken to a whole new level. The comedy stayed in the interactions between the characters while the plot and action seemed like a very serious threat for once, keeping us on the edge of our seats. Avengers: Age of Ultron takes place shortly after the events of The Winter Solider, yet it's a step back into light, silly cartoon action where there's no real feeling of danger. As threatening as Ultron is, we never worry that one of the Avengers might actually die. And even if they did, we know they won't stay dead.

Between what James Gunn did with Guardians of the Galaxy and the Russo brothers with Winter Solider, the stakes were raised too high for the over-confident, under-talented Joss Whedon. Age of Ultron gets too close to a Michael Bay film with so many failed attempt at humor, tension and surprise.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Messy movie. The first wasn't perfect, but it seemed polished and on-point, with a clear creative vision and a sensible story-arc. This one seemed very disjointed in its writing and even in its editing, particularly surrounding Scarlet Witch scenes and the various dream-sequences she inspires. It was oddly difficult to track the characters during fight-scenes, them seemingly warping all over the place with minimal continuity, especially toward the end. Ultron was a weak villain, his nonchalant attitude and all-too-human foibles/quirks seeming distinctly at odds with his motive. Also, obligatory 9/11 reference was obligatory, not to mention offencive and in extremely poor taste. Every superhero movie these days seems disturbingly obliged to include scenes in which terrified citizens run from advancing clouds of concrete-dust as seen on 9/11, but this one went one step further by actually collapsing a skyscraper in the 'pancake' method to get that result.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This movie is a straight out commercial film without any serious plot and with a lot of one liner jokes. Seems like Marvel is ripping themselves, Age of Ultron is very similar to The Avengers and The Guardians of the Galaxy. The super hero team is divided in the starting only to unite by the end of the film to defeat the antagonist.

From the beginning of the movie we can see that the story will set the plot for the future Marvel movies Civil War, Avengers Infinity Wars part 1 and part 2.

The main antagonist Ultron doesn't seem like a serious guy. Even he has his one liners. I couldn't take Ultron seriously from the beginning of the movie except for his appearance. Ultron is supposed to be a really serious character, impossible to outsmart and difficult to beat.

The locations were really good and the graphics were superb. But the 3d was like any other film.

There was not much seriousness to the characters, all the director cared about was which character gets the last one liner. Iam not really sure why Captain America says ""language"", even after he fought in the world war, he got beaten up on the streets.

Overall I will not be expecting the future Avengers films to outdo this film.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,The writing seems to be quickly written. But the editing - damn it's bad.,4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"This is another over hyped movie where the consensus of critical opinion is better than it should be. The movie Avataar comes to mind. That movie too had a similar largely favorable reviews on release but was later found to be underwhelming.

The plot is thin. The birth of the Ultron is hurried, the tender moments seemed tacked, the fight scene at the end is a reprise of the fight scenes in the first Avengers movie. The birth of the Vision may be useful in later films but here he hardly plays any role. The death of Pietro is similarly accidental. The fight between the Avengers seems pointless, and looks like a school brawl. Even the looming end of the world fails to inspire any sense of urgency or dread.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I absolutely hate CGI that is so obviously CGI.

It makes live action look like a cartoon. CGI only works when it's so subtle you don't notice it. The very first scene is an action one with so much CGI it may as well be animated. This utterly sets the bar so low as to be limboing for me. It didn't get any better as it went along either. A real shame as previous Avengers efforts were much better.

The plot was contrived to the Nth degree and the acting was phoned in. The actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere but where they were.

I appreciate that any superhero film requires a degree of suspension of reality but equally it also needs a degree of reality to ground it. Failure to adhere to that grounding leaves you with a live action cartoon, which is what we have here. It simply doesn't work.

Please, please, please abandon the over use of CGI and make films that rely on plot, acting and effects you don't realise are effects.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"I'd give this a pass. Well, unless you're trying to track every movement of every infinity stone, then this would be kind of essential. That's probably not a spoiler since they're in like every other MCU movie... Some references are in Captain America: Civil War, but you can live without them.

The dialogue is just bad. There's no other word for it. It's stiff, unnatural and weird. It's at the worst when most of the ensemble is present. Character motivations and reactions are also all over the place. Someone is doing something potentially reckless and extremely dangerous, others tell him to stop it, he says ""no"", and the others just go like ""well I suppose just go ahead then"". There's also a couple of fairly major plot points that were just ""deus ex machina"" style random whatevers.

The AI plotline is utterly asinine. I suppose that's a bit hard to avoid in a film like this. However, Ultron as the antagonist is a fairly compelling character. He's actually strong enough to fight the whole gang. I just wish he wasn't in such a dud of a movie.

I very much like the big evil plot at the end of the movie. That's a great idea! Unfortunately the fight takes way too long, and this ""setpiece"" by itself is not able to elevate the movie.

BTW, I started my reviews from MCU with this acco (forgot my login and pass lol), and I'm not grading them low just because I'm a hater for the genre or franchise. This just ain't a good movie in my opinion. My experience with MCU is very positive.",4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,"While not as good as the first Avengers movie, Age og Ultron, brings a lot of new stuff to the table, such as Scarlett Witch, Quick Silver, Ultron himself, The Vision and much more. The climax is also very well made and overall the movie is as i said, Pretty Good",4
Avengers: Endgame,"I stuck with Marvel for way longer than I should have. Kept thinking that eventually Kevin Feige would stop being a misogynistic ass. When he handed the reins to the Russo brothers, I should have known it was not going to get better. Ignore the ridiculous way this played out just so that they would lose in IW and kill people in EG. The treatment of Black Widow was just the last straw for me. Nat, not Tony or Steve or Bruce or Thor or Clint, held what is left of the Avengers together and kept fighting. Nat held it all together. Nat showed all the strength that a leader should have. Nat is a good person who keeps fighting. With Chris Evans and RDJ leaving, the stage was set to let Black Widow shine. Instead, it is a stupid, contrived, pointless death that in an interview the Russo brothers said that they needed something to motivate the men. Are you f#%*%#* kidding me?! Killing the little lady to motivate her man one of the oldest most misogynistic pieces of crap. Nat was motivated already. She didn't need some pointless death to convince her to fight. And then to sit by the lake for a minute and ask if she had family and then what? Nothing. Then to make matters worse, some big hero's sendoff for Tony but nothing for Nat. Utter misogynistic BS!

And just wow, what a depressing arc for your main female. We know that she never felt like she did enough good, never really believed that she was a good person. And AoU made sure to call her a monster for not being able to have children. Tony is forgiven for all his sins, of which there are many, finds love and is a hero. Steve literally messes with time to get his love. The world be damned. Clint is apparently forgiven for being a mass murdering vigilante, so he can go back to his family and suffer no consequences. But not Nat, she never feels forgiven or good enough or that she deserves love or even to live. And I guess the lesson is that the men can be forgiven for all their crimes and sins, one's they did of their own free choice, but the women cannot. But hey, as long as her death motivates the boys to fight. Wtf!",1
Avengers: Endgame,"Great but confusing

I'm bored I dunno what to do now Pfffff",1
Avengers: Endgame,Avengers is the best best movie ever made. Iron man is awesome and so is hulk. Both blacks are also awesome (panther and window). This movie is way better than Infinity warfare becoz so many ppl die in infinity wars but in TEG very little ppl die and almost all that die are Thanos ppl and even if someone good dies now u can always bring them back which is awesome.,1
Avengers: Endgame,"Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films.

Avengers: Endgame,"I'm no Marvel fan but I'll tell you that Infinity War was one of the best films from Disney's Marvel that I had ever seen.

The ending was new and despite the fact that we all KNEW that those lost in the first film weren't truly lost forever; it was still a great moment.

My loser mate actually cried at the ending and I laughed at him. But he loves Marvel and I envy his blind loyalty and his ability to be entertained and amused by films that do very little for those that love an intelligent plot.

Here, (and I'll be shocked if you see this as a spoiler) everything is reversed.

In a painfully long and boring 3 hours. Everything awesome about that first film is undone in exchange for Fat Thor, Soyboy Hulk and some really depressed iconic superheroes.

They drag this out for over an hour before anything entertaining happens and you're beyond bored by that point. So bored that you cannot possibly care that the most insanely overpowered but incredibly well acted supervillain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is about to be defeated by one hero's sacrifice.

Even my friend couldn't muster up a tear this time. As much as he loves his Marvel, they had unfortunately beaten him to death with unfunny content and boring scenes that are almost completely inconsequential to the entire plot to the point where even he, a die hard fan, stopped caring.

That was the truly tragic moment in my cinema for me. Other than the fact that I too was watching this film.

Normally when I review Marvel films, I'll say ""If you're a die hard Marvel fan than you'll likely love this"" but I can't even do that for this film.

It's boring, it's long and it undid the only cool film Disney's Marvel ever made.

A true tragedy if ever I did see one.",1

Avengers: Endgame,"This is the worst ever movie made in the history of superhero movies, and that includes Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern. Just when you think marvel can't make a movie bad than Captain Marvel, BAMM!!! Here come Avengers Endgame.",1
Avengers: Endgame,"I watched OlIronman because of Robert Downey Jr. I realized that those people who rates these mawel movies have no fundamental knowledge of the history of cinema . They are mentally teenagers, who are amazed of a couple of computer effect (not even modelling like SW in 1977) and give a 10 for all these kind of invaluable peace of data. In the other hand, we cinephile people compare the best movies to the best ever including the silent era. Italian neo realism Golden age of Hollywood etcetera . Hence not surprising that this film has 8.4 rating while Parasite (for example) a Masterpiece of the Korean cinema has only 8.5.. A slightly better as it seems, however, there is unspeakable different in quality between the two movies. We need an objective standard. This is like presidental election in US. All the uneducated and unintelligent people are heavily influence the final result. Superhero movies are for the children, not for people who ever care to watch real movies, with characters, unpredictable story and realistic acting.",1
Avengers: Endgame,"My nephew recently asked us to watch *Avengers: Infinity War*, so we sat down and gave it a go. We thoroughly enjoyed it-it was a very good movie. The fight scenes were well-made, the CGI was incredibly sharp, and most of the scenes, from the space battles to the showdown in Wakanda, were highly enjoyable. What stood out most, however, was the character of Thanos. For a superhero movie, you wouldn't expect such a well-written villain with a noble, almost altruistic objective. Unlike most villains in this genre, who are typically driven by power, greed, or personal motives, Thanos sees himself as the savior of the universe. His belief that his actions are for the greater good adds depth to his character. This is especially evident in his heart-wrenching sacrifice of his daughter to obtain the Soul Stone.

The ending of *Infinity War* was the cherry on top-a satisfying conclusion that left us in awe. The final scene, where a worn-out Thanos retires to a rustic lifestyle, perfectly encapsulated his character and sold the entire movie for us. Of course, we knew Hollywood wouldn't end the franchise on such a note. After all, in these stories, the ""good guys"" (the Avengers) must always win. So, we were curious to see how they would resolve everything in the final installment of the franchise, *Avengers: Endgame*.

Unfortunately, *Endgame* was a massive disappointment. The first hour of the movie was nothing but endless talking. We quickly noticed that something felt off-the movie, as a whole, looked visually unimpressive. From the very first scenes, the cinematography felt more like a TV show than a blockbuster film. The lighting was poor, and the pacing was horrendous. Nothing significant happened in the first hour except for the reveal of their plan to fix everything, which turned out to be the biggest cop-out ever.

Whenever a movie resorts to time travel shenanigans, it's usually a sign of lazy writing. Time travel is one of the most overused and poorly executed devices in entertainment, and *Endgame* is no exception. It's rarely done well and often serves as a deus ex machina to resolve plot holes. To make matters worse, the CGI in *Endgame* was some of the worst I've seen in recent years. Thanos, who looked stunning in *Infinity War*, now appeared like a character straight out of a video game. For a $450 million production, the over-reliance on green screens was painfully obvious, and it showed.

The ending was entirely predictable. Every twist and turn felt telegraphed, leaving no room for surprise or excitement. Unlike *Infinity War*, which kept us on the edge of our seats, *Endgame* felt formulaic and uninspired. The movie's visual quality was another letdown-it looked like a TV production, not a cinematic masterpiece. Even the emotional sacrifice at the end, meant to add weight to the story, felt inevitable and lacked impact.

In short, *Endgame* was a letdown in almost every way. It's longer than *Infinity War* but feels bloated with unnecessary dialogue and repetitive exposition. While *Infinity War* was thrilling, visually stunning, and left us wanting more, *Endgame* was a slog that failed to live up to its predecessor. If you're considering watching it, I'd say it's not worth your time. Stick with *Infinity War*-it's the better movie in every way.",1

Avengers: Endgame,"And bad on SO MANY LEVELS.

The script -- monosyllabic (Look it up those who didn't get their GED).

The cast -- a stock company of actors almost all of whom are way too old for their roles, especially Mark Ruffalo and yes, Robert Downey ""Jr."". One wonders how much they had to pay Redford...or was he just that desperate to be seen as relevant by the milennials?

Horrible directing -- you can just hear the director say, ""Okay, now everyone -- put on your 'serious' face.""

The Hulk gags. UNFUNNY.

And last but not least, a talking RACOON.",1
Avengers: Endgame,For all the money this movie cost nobody wanted to pay for a decent script. No just let Bruce banner explain time travel in three seconds. This is just as bad as Superman turning the earth backwards to save lois Lane. For the money this cost this movie both sucks and is insulting.,1
Avengers: Endgame,"Horrible movie, ruined what could have been a great infinity war movie...timeline story lines work if it's simple and straightforward, but with something as involved as Avengers time travel was a hacky technique to use resolve Thanos's decision. Lame. If time travel is the solution to anything bad, why have villains at all? These writers have destroyed the marvel universe movies forever. The only reason it's a 4 out of 10 is all the other movies that helped build characters.",1
Avengers: Endgame,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a major letdown for the superhero genre. The film's story is poorly written and executed, lacking the emotional depth and tension that made previous entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) so memorable. The reunion between Captain America and Iron Man is a prime example of this: it lacks the emotional impact it should have had and instead comes off as insipid and pointless.

The script was careless and illogical, treating the death of beloved heroes as a casual decision, with jokes and humor detracting from any remaining emotional impact. The three main heroes - Iron Man, Black Widow, and Captain America - are written in a haphazard manner, with their motivations and decisions feeling illogical and naive. The film's humor, while entertaining in some moments, takes away from the emotional impact of some scenes and feels out of place. The introduction of space travel further detracts from the film's emotional impact, as death and life are treated as things that can be tampered with at will. The death of several heroes should have been a moving moment, but instead, it falls flat. The cries and fainting of some fans in the theater speaks to the influence of MCU's ten-year build-up, not the quality of the film itself.

The film's use of time travel is lazy and fails to provide the sense of epicness and sadness that some expect. The screenwriter took the easy way out by solving most of the film's conflicts with ""Deus ex machina,"" leaving little room for suspense or tension, and the biggest threat, Thanos, is defeated in a simple and uneventful manner. The humor and anti-climax jokes, a staple of MCU films, do more harm than good, breaking the atmosphere of several scenes. The film's climax, which captures all the heroes in one shot, is a thrilling moment, but it's also a clear indication of MCU's real priorities: fan service and making money, not creating a meaningful story.

In conclusion, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a disappointing reminder of the decline of the superhero genre. The film is a prime example of the negative impact of greed, lack of creativity, and toxic fan culture on the film industry. As superhero movies become the dominant interest for more and more audiences, it's a warning that the genre, and perhaps even the film industry as a whole, is at risk of being destroyed.",1
Avengers: Endgame,"As the title says. The story is meaningless, it does nothing but reinforce cliché narratives and the status quo. There is nothing special about this movie. The actors are fine, whatever. But the fights are completely expected, the storyline is completely expected, and at best it's just a show of what Marvel's intellectual property includes and how many actors they are able to woo with their massive budgets. It's the same boring back-and-forth with mindless, predictable, and corny one-liners. It's the same narrative of how great the vanguard of society is, unaccountable to anyone, completely lacking in permanent societal disruptiveness. And it's the same useless profit-seeking plotline centered around the same settings, characters, and expectations as usual.",1
Avengers: Endgame,"First half of movie is very slow, and humor lacking for a marvel movie.. second half is definitely better, but still does not live up to hype",1
Avengers: Endgame,"Russo Brothers gave the GENERAL audience exactly what they wanted. I would've not changed a thing to make the money they did. But if I had the talent of a Martin S. or Christopher N. this would have been better than infinity war (which was amazing!!). Cookie cutter storyline with untimely comedy. Too much comedic relief with poor dialogue and horrible storyline. Thanos seems to be a typical bad guy whereas in infinity war there was much depth to him...you could almost sympathize with him. A lot of Easter eggs if you like them. If youre a sheep you will love this movie. If you think for yourself and looking for a rich cinematic storyline that can keep you focused, this film would give the same enjoyment as Toy Story",1
Avengers: Endgame,"I mean y'know, they did a good job, but plot is a little boring. definitely not worth 3 hours. overall decent movie",1

I've been always a super hero's fan movie, like Superman, Batman, WonderWoman, Iron Man, etc but this is not even popcorn entertainment, then I see total reviews 8.4, compared ""Braveheart"" Oscar Winner 8.3...well I must say that IMDB is full of ""deceived"" voters, I doesn't feel right to use other word... Next time you search for a movie with total reviews scored 5 or 6 something, always give the benefit of doubt. Because true real entertainment cinema lovers/voters are just a few in IMDB.

I'm voting 1 because true voters must know what's going on in IMDB. Otherwise I would vote 6 for the efforts and respect for the cast and production.",1
Avengers: Endgame,Disney.. my god i waited for this movie so many years and yeah this movie sucked IF i am gonna be honest. Feminist propaganda ofc and they maked hulk and Thor the strongest avengers the most weak avengers.😂 It had some good parts but infinity war was so more epic and better I hate Disney becuse they ruin movies,1
Avengers: Endgame,"EndGame is an epic finale to one of the greatest infinity saga. God the movie is fantastic!!! I laughed, i cried and i cheered for the movie. I wont write much or spoilers would come out of my mouth. Its all what marvel fans have been waiting for. I will write another review after Monday so that my review can be filled with Spoilers!!!",1

Avengers: Endgame,"Smart Hulk, fat-alcoholic Thor, moronic Stark (oh, wait...), this is a bad comedy.

Final battle is a complete mess. Too much CGI, not enough story. Laughable dialogue, with a few good lines, but... Come on, this movie is 3 hours long!",1
Avengers: Endgame,"The film is filled with numerous plot holes involving bad story writing, character flaws, and just straight up cringe worthy moments. The characters are butchered to where so many character arcs are just ignored all to do a fan service film. Fat-Thor is a terrible arc, butchering his entire growth and history in his past films. Even Thanos' character arc is destroyed because in infinity war he's made to believe his actions are justified, but in here he's just straight up made into your stereotypical bad guy that wants power. Then you have storylines like Civil War that are just completely washed away without any consideration once they get to the time travel mechanic. Which going to that, has so many plot holes. There are various ideologies to how time travel works but this film follows several that really just disprove each other. Not to mention how the mechanics or tools needed for their time travel is really just tossed aside itself in moments like Captain marvel trying to get the stones to the van when she had no particles nor a suit. Even the final battle is truly a joke, because the avengers are basically just punching and kicking a bunch of manikins, with little to no losses from Thanos' army, theres truly no tension within the battle. They couldve easily made it where the stones get divided where the good and bad guys are trying to collect them. I can go on and on but this film overall is just a fanscription flick, a way to create gaps and plot holes that'll allow them to make more films and shows. The MCU is overstating it's welcome and this film is deeply overrated as people just see the pretty colors rather than actually looking at the story.",1
Avengers: Endgame,"I loved the Sam Raimi spiderman movies as a kid but haven't watched any super hero movies since. Decided to give this a shot while it was in theaters since it was such a huge block buster at the time.

There wasn't a single character I felt anything for, firstly because there's so many of them and also because none of them felt real. None of their actions or dialogue had any weight, the movie didn't take a moment to explore anything more than cliche, forced ""heartfelt"" moments and ""witty"" banter that was more cringe-inducing than anything.

No practical effects were used in this film, it's 100% CGI and it shows. When compared to a real blockbuster film of similar scale - Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings, Avengers: Endgame DOES NOT HOLD UP. Peter Jacksons use of miniature work, costumes, set pieces and practical effects puts this to shame. The ending fight scene was just CGI chaos, similar to that Ready Player One race scene; no idea what's going on but the movie never once gives the audience the feeling that the heroes are in any real danger.

The story was so convoluted, it can be explained as such: ""We need to time travel to get the macguffin so we can stop the bad guy"" Somehow, they manage to stretch that out and it really shows the limitations of the writers imaginations.

I could not keep any interest in this mess. And unless you're a 30 year old manchild who collects Funko-Pop figures and wears a dead pool graphic T shirt everyday, this movie is for teenage boys.",1
Avengers: Endgame,"The more I think about this movie the more disappointed I am. And the more I try to pretend it never happened.

In the cinema I was sort of swept in all the pictures but as pretty as they were, they don't really hold up very well under closer scrutiny. They are like cotton candy, it looks really nice, is very sweet but in the end, it's just sugar.

There was very little substance and they tried to fill the movie with surprises and twists and the unexpected to hide it. And they kind of failed.

There were some story points that were handled very well. Some that could be hand-waved into appreciation. And then some that were just straight up terrible - e.g. the whole Steve's story line.

After all the build up in the previous movies, this movie was kind of a let down.

And my question stands: What about Bucky?",2
Avengers: Endgame,"Not only I didn't like the movie, I actually hated it. This was a bad movie and a total mess. So many holes in the plot. Deliberately bad acting from good actors and too much footage given to bad actors and weak characters. Ruined the entire series for me.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"One of the most mediocre (if not the most) Marvel movies ever. Even the second ""Tour"" was more meaningful. Here everything was drowned in a sea of pathos and senseless action - it was still impossible to keep track of all the characters in it, so I didn't want to worry about anyone. If it weren't for the wonderful Chris Hemsworth, who is absolutely on his wave throughout the film, and Hiddlestone's cameo (Marvel without Loki is still not Marvel), it would be impossible to watch at all. The whole first half of the film the action did not begin in any way, and the whole second I wanted to get up and go home.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"CN's weekend movies have better storyline and story telling than this plot hole infested and fan-service movie. The over-hyped, over rated film comes off as fan-made movie. With the budget of more than 300 million dollars and the fact that movie crew had a whole decade of time period the cgi on hulk in p.c scene is still early 2000s of a b rated movie.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"I get bored watching this. Maybe this movie is not my cup of tea, the fantastical fight in it.... I just don't feel it. I don't understand the hype of from this movie. Maybe because the target market is for all age and build for fun and family to watch.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"With that many Avenger movies out there when this one was made the makers assumed there was no way that someone would be watching this without a background story.

Now they have had time to perfect the VFX. The characters are established. We see plenty of old and new characters.

O.k. It is about time; it looks like Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) are about to be dispatched right off. We see the remainder of the last story.

Now for the new get ready for convoluted time travel that includes all the nifty fight scenes and a few losses. Even the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin), created by Jim Starlin, does some farming and sautéing.

The best part of the film is the ending credits as there are so many great actors that match the faces with the names. They had to cut it short so we do not get faces with names for approximately 65 uncredited actors.

You think it is finally all over - Oh, Great Scott it is Captain Marvel 2 (Brie Larson).",2
Avengers: Endgame,"Are you kidding? Why does this movie exist? Didn't everything end PERFECTLY in Infinity War? Who needs a sequel and for the story to keep getting squeezed out like all those characters who ended their story so interestingly!

Total boredom on top of that! CGI that is far from the best. Acting - OK, but more drooling actors than adequately standing in front of the camera.

Totally ruining all the character development created so far in the MCU.

The funny scenes are woeful in a bad way, the story is boring and unrealistic, and unnecessarily long! Total crap.

I have no words!

Final score: 2/10.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"This movie could be summarized as three portions of roughly 1 hour each, totalling a whopping 3-hour movie. I have to say, had this movie been a 2-hour deal, with them collecting the stones from the past and snapping their fingers to make everything right, it would at least have been decent. But no, they had to create a cringe fest.

The first half is interesting enough, it builds up on how the erasure of half of the population affected the lives of everyone. It felt like a movie, albeit a very long and tedious one. The second portion is still decent, it revolves around them going back in time to try to right the wrongs of the present. It goes through some of the scenes found in the first Avengers movie, which was interesting. Yes, it's basically a time travel story, how original.

The last portion is just ridiculous. It's basically a gigantic battle between Thano's minions and several super-heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There's no rhyme or reason for anything that happens there, it's just a constant shift from one super-hero to another, showcasing some individual battle where they ultimately triumph. Who is winning? Who is losing? What's happening on a grand scale? No one knows. It's just dumb Hollywood crap.

Aside from the clichéd time travel story - and a very bad one at that -, the whole movie revolves around two Deus Ex Machina moments. In one of them, Captain Marvel saves Iron Man from dying of oxygen depletion in space. He eventually goes on to discover a way to travel back in time, allowing everything that comes after to happen. The other, Captain Marvel descends from the sky to destroy the main ship which Thanos was using to invade the Earth. Having one of the highest budgets of all time for a plot like this is unacceptable.

This is just a celebration about everything that is wrong with Hollywood. It's stupidity taken to the extreme. The fact that this movie is a box office success just shows how much marketing plays a role in crafting a successful movie. Yes, crafting success in and of itself, because the substance for it is just not there.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"If Marvel had a priority list 1- CGI 2- Cool One liner 3- Fight 4- Explosion 5- Fight 6- Laser 7- Fight 46172- Characters are intelligent 6982243- Even if it's science fiction, the scenario should make sense.

An other brainless story of Marvel. The story revolve around the fact that Thanos MUST not gather all the infinity stone. So scene after scene you'll see every one of the ""superheroes"" bringing their stone with them to fight Thanos alone. Brilliant

And the final fight for the latest stone, is a fight organized at Wakanda. So the army of Thanos come from a faraway galaxy in a spaceship to fight the Avengers with... Swords yes. It makes total sense.

Marvel's writers are not even trying anymore. The movies are commercial CGI vessels dedicated to create mass marketing campaign, nice trailer and a new reason to produce merch.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"A confusing mess.

Much like the rest of this series.

I stuck with it due to the strong reviews but I didn't understand what on earth (no pun intended) was going on and trying to explain what was going on to my young son...well I gave up in the end.

It's just way too confusing and unnecessarily long in the process, surely they could have shaved an hour off this?

It's as if Hollywood has got so proud of the special effects and what it can do now that decent plots have gone out the window.

A popular series...but sorry I just don't get it.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"The long awaited finale to the latest Avengers incarnation, is a disappointment in terms of story and plot. There is no story here of course, this is just Infinity War Part 2. Although IF was an entertaining upbeat Avengers movie a vast improvement of Ultron, it was ultimately let down buy an extremely thin unoriginal premise.

Time Travel! Yes, that was the only way they were going to reverse what Thanos had achieved in part 1. The way it was introduced and put in the story line as an everyday easily conjured up premise, a weapon, a device, was almost laughable, but eerily familiar, as seen in so many movies, TV shows, comics, books, etc. It was like ""Hey Presto, Time Travel, hooray, problem solved now onto the meat of the story, which was basically going back through some of the earlier MCU movies, steal stuff, try not to mess it up seeing earlier versions of themselves and other awkward situations, seen it before? Yes, dozens of times, boring, lazy artifice pushed into this.

Anyway, earlier we saw the defeated surviving miscreants travel, again, easily finding Thanos in an old hut somewhere, then dealing with him, case closed right? No, then we go on to a mindless segue to see how fat and retiring Thor had become, an embarrassment to be sure.

Skipping forward after the time travel artifice has been seen through, we get to the final battle, its huge and messy, somewhat dull, and of course its all for nothing as Captain Marvel is so unstoppable she brings down the whole show on her own, then some tear jerking moments are added in for dramatic effect and to make sure this will be the final performance of some of the characters.

Like an earlier blockbuster, LOTR part 3, there are one 2 many endings.

All in all, there is no story here, a lazy plot device, Time Travel to get them all out of trouble and misery. Who could've predicted it?

This movie was so hotly anticipated it was always going to break records at the box office, on the back of the success and open ended ending of IF, that is the real winner here, a successful movie in every way for its genre, Infinity War, alas somewhat diminished by a lazy plot hole ridden lazy sequel, a record breaking smash hit.

What a shame?

But a delight for undemanding pop culture fans, and MCU fans alike.",2
Avengers: Endgame,I watched this movie last year and i was not happy at all. Its just a drag and its so cringe in some parts of it that makes me want to vomit. Thanos was a big baby here and everyone is just so useless against him?? Its just nonsense!,2
Avengers: Endgame,I gave it 2 stars because THANUS should have died a more horrible death than disinergrating !!! In a cloud of dust . Other than that it was great . I just could see THANUS suffering a horrible painful long death like all the people he wasted . Stan lee could have done lots better.,2
Avengers: Endgame,It started off alright but then it messed with time travel and it just got worse. It devolved into chaos and everyone was screwed over.,2
Avengers: Endgame,I cannot believe the reviews of this movie. I almost walked out of this film and I loved comics growing up. It's so hard to watch no fun very slow and boring with a stupid plot horrible script it's actually embarrassing for how far they've come to finish off this way. They tried so hard to make it sentimental and failed miserably. It should have been 30 minutes and focused on Hawkeye. I didn't feel anything but numb. Oh and of course they had to throw in girl power on steroids I nearly threw up. Watching Captain America iron Man Thor and hulk look and act so pathetic for the mass majority of the movie was painful.,2
Avengers: Endgame,"""After the years of a big buildup what a big let down . There was plot hole after plot hole and little action scenes. Thanos was like a little girl in comparison to infinity war . Captain Marvel one of the most powerful in the galaxy was on annual leave only there for little bits . The Hulk was a disappointment. Thoese rating a high score are just not watching the movie at all .""

I have to agree with this statement, plot holes all over the movie.. but in the other hand if you like a visual appealing movie and you are a Tony Stark/Iron Man fan well i guess its not a completly waste.

In other words, I wouldnt pay to see it again.",2
Avengers: Endgame,It's entertaining but not great. It's like all marvel movies nothing new.,2
Avengers: Endgame,"It's as though Marvel tried to destroy its own franchise in one movie. They make fun of their own creation. Fat Drunken Thor, really? That's America's? Smart Hulk? I didn't care whether any of the characters lived through this one. And if they die, so what? They went back in time to save half the universe already.

And the present Avengers were incompetent in the past. Why? For a bit of comedy? The dwarves from Time Bandits were better at time heists than these morons.

I wish I hadn't watched this one. It poisoned the rest of the franchise. I don't know if I'll waste my time re-watching older MCU movies knowing the way this ended it.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"I personally have not been a fan of the avengers since the russo brothers took over. The acting in this film was like watching a middle school play. No emotion from anyone except jeremy renner and rdj. Way too long and the plot was just stupid, i think this goes to show huge budget definitely doesn't make a amazing movie.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"This film is more than 3 hours long. The length is totally unjustified and merely makes the bland dialogue and CGI dependent fight scenes even more tortuous than they would have been had this been half the length. No element of real danger, little intelligent wit. Avengers: Endgame is the epitome of the malaise in the movies that studios and the public choose to make and watch. You will not get these three hours back again.",2

Let's get some CGI going, so happy we do not understand even the basics of the human psyche. Let's make sure no-one does! Let us judge everyone for we are truly better. Let's keep that PC flag flying high. Let's not see anything that it real, let's polish the world. We all hate real movies. Alpa Chino truly stands for Booty Sweat. Thank you so much!",2
Avengers: Endgame,"Just watched the movie. Despite my best wishes, I simply cannot find myself singing praises to such a poorly-done movie.

Throughout the movie I found myself sitting in utter disbelief as to how Endgame went so wrong after a fantastic Infinity War.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"Average. 1st 2hr you will die. If are till the end, last 45 will satisfy you. It's Captain and Thor show and in the end we missed the Iron Man. Rip",2
Avengers: Endgame,"Soulless junk. The first act promised a serious take on the nature of revenge but the movie quickly gave up on interesting thematic and became a senseless mess.

I didn't care for a single character, the action was a confusing mess and the new characters do not give me much hope in the future of these Marvel films. On the plus side, this may mean diminishing returns on future instalments in this ""cinematic universe"" which would be great news for original films that aren't getting screened theatrically from the many megaplex screens being eaten up by this cynical capitalist trash. But hey... maybe the kids like it?",2
Avengers: Endgame,"Endgame is filled with emotions, great scenes, beautiful cinematograhpy, and above all else; fantastic entertainment! This is what u would expect from a great superhero movie - so many great moments and wonderful send-offs to some characters. Still I was not sold. I have a few nit-picks, but will ignore those for the big objections that brings the score down. But first the positives.

This is the best most crowd pleasing Avengers movie yet, and as already mention; this movie is so beautiful to watch. The action fantastic! All the characters are great, but Iron Man, Black widow and cap america have absolutely stunning performances. Almost everything about this movie is top, top, top!

Still, I will only give it a 2/10, which is actually generous. Let me tell you why.

First, Thanos. Almost a full movie dedicated to this villain now and we know almost nothing about him. He wants to kill half the universe because... ???What drives him? Why collecting his ""children""? He is dangerous, strong, and the biggest foe, but who is he? I was hoping some would be explained, but no. They instead make him more comical evil in this movie, why?

Time travel sucks. No matter how good explanations are or what u do with it, time travel creates paradoxes, lingering questions, plot holes, and in this movie it creates evil Steve..

Speaking of; Captain America is evil! Yes, in this movie he rips poor peggy from her husband and children so Cap can get laid. Horrible ending of the movie!

Fat lazy Thor, and another dumb usage of Hulk, Loki! And that stupid girl power pose... oh God that was so cringe. I loved Cap Marvel movie, but here she is a deus ex machina - how did she fly that ship millions of light years without Tony dying? 2sec? Really?

The more I think of the movie the lower my score becomes. I started with 7/10 just after seeing it, now I have it at 5/10 and Im not seeing it again. Way too many plot holes and major flaws.

Edit: Saw it online today, and it is really badly put together movie. Got even more disappointed, so I will lower the score again to 4/10. I cannot go lower though since I have Wonder Woman on the same score, and Endgame is not worse than WW so I will keep it there. So, so disappointed... how could the Russo´s make such a bad movie? What happen?

Edit2: After re-watching the fantastic Captain Marvel, which is one of if not the best superhero movie ever made, I decided to watch this trash again and I now believe Endgame to be one of the worst superhero movies ever made. It is not JL or BvS bad, but not far from it. Lowered the score to 2/10. This movie suck, and anyone claiming this is a good movie is a moron.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"I had lost my interest in Marvel films a long time ago, but I kept watching them, hoping that one day another good one like 'Iron Man' (2008) or 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014) would be released. When they announced the two-part final Avenger movies, I had high hopes: there was much potential there... only a pity that the makers completely blew there chances of winning me (and many others I'm sure) back; especially with this one.

The first half of this film was just plain stupidly boring. When watching Marvel movies I expect farfetched plots, lots of action and some underbelly that moves the characters and the story. But this underbelly changed the characters themselves. Thor, Iron Man, the bloody Hulk! Why? Superhero-movies aren't supposed to have character development in this way, and surely not development that feels to be written by people that have no idea how real people change. Besides that, the characters for an hour and a half just walk and talk... in an action movie. WALK AND TALK! What's up with that? Where is the action? Where is the excitement? Why do they all act as if their personal struggles are of any interest to us, the audience? Marvel has already made sure we don't really care for the characters in their previous films, so don't pretend like we do.

The second half of the film was better: there was some action and the way the makers incorporated the previous films into this was very well done and amusing. The plot finally kicks off and although most of it was quite predictable, it was better. But the only part of the movie that I truly enjoyed and (well, maybe) loved, was the final battle. THAT'S what we want to see: all the Avengers fighting side by side, kicking ass, jumping, swinging and being EPIC. This was also where the score by Alan Silvestry stood out and it gave me goose bumps (gotta love that main theme). The ending was stupid again though. Dr. Strange told everyone that there was only ONE possible outcome in - what? - a trillion; I honestly don't remember. But when that one in a trillion happened, I could not help but think ""truly? THAT is the one? What a f..... waste."" And then Tony died... I guess it was sad, but please, I could smell that coming from miles away.

The music is okay; Silvestry can do better, but didn't. I do blame the directors and the producers for that actually. The special effects are absolutely astonishing! Nothing to say against that! Whoever worked on that: you can be proud of yourself, because the CGI rocks! Acting ranges from mediocre to bad. Overhyped, overly advertised, more bore than actual good filmmaking.

One thing is a given: I am not watching any new Marvel movies ever. I won't grant them the money to continue with their follies. The superhero-genre is as good as dead - has been dying for quite some time actually - and nothing they attempt will bring it back. Deal with it and start making some new movies. And perhaps in a dozen or so years superhero-films will be brought back, starting a thing we'll probably call the 'neosuperheromovie'.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"There are two types of Marvel fans: Those that are true to the cinematic universe, and those that grew up embracing the comic book universe. You'll know who's who by hearing their opinion, or reading their review. To mine, I believe there were far too many opportunities missed where this movie could've leapt to incredible heights.

Unfortunately, the universe and popular comic book story lines were sacrificed to cater for politically correct propaganda. Definitely a missed opportunity, and a sour end to a great run of films (excluding Captain Marvel).",3
Avengers: Endgame,At what stage does a movie cease to be deserved to be called a movie ? That was in the forefront on my mind when I watched the CGI characters that were. Bound together by flimsy plots that did not deserve the full running time. The music was fantastic and the long term marketing strategy worked in its favour. Apart from that; the overdose of the weak acting of lead actors where it was difficult to understand if the humans were humans and to stretch our imagination to clearly reframe CGI characters as humanoid proved to be challenging at best of times. That said; it is a movie that can left running in the background while you do your work.,3
Avengers: Endgame,"Well, lets start by saying that i was never too much of a marvel fan, their movies dont appeal much to me, but this has got to be one of the worst, some really unexpected CGI errors (but were minor and i would let it pass), the pace was so bad i would think this a first for the writer, confusing starting really fast, slowing down a bunch just kick it up for flash type of fast, they tried to make a whole thing about how the earth fell to crap after the snap, but they dont care to explain why or how, it just did, for example why would baseball stop, did Thanos kill every baseball fan? the whole scene was settled so bad, forced jokes ruining everything, they killed 2 characters, the Hulk and Thor were so weird and didn't make any sense, Thanos was weird too but i will get to that later. The hole time travel thing is so confusing and doesn't make any sense, ant-man learns that time works different in nano universe or something like that, but how does that even explain them going back in time. for some reason after all this time travel confusion nebula just opens up a portal that a fits a huge ship, why didn't they do that, what are those suit for if they can simply open up a big portal? second of all where did she get the Pym particles? and third hulk couldn't figure out that machine but nebula can? well after all of this we have a fight scene where Thor, Iron-man and Captain America were getting their asses beat by Thanos, in infinity war with 2 or 3 stones (Not sure) they almost defeated Thanos, why is it so hard now that he has none. The big battle after that is confusing and is trying too hard, they want put everyone in it and it just feels weird and confusing, i was always lost And the end was cliché with Thanos turning into dust and then iron-man dying, eventough i liked iron-man death it was still a bit cheesy and not that emotional. the captain american end was awful, he couldn't get over his old love and went back to it, ruining her life, since she is described as very intelligent and INDEPENDENT",3
Avengers: Endgame,"""Avengers: The Final Solution"" is not about pathological speeches and camera rushes in front of the heroes' manly faces (although there is sometimes too much of that in the film). Through the lenses of professional technology, we see Pepper Potts' wrinkles, Valkyrie's weary gaze, Steve Rogers' first gray hair. Along with ""The Avengers,"" millions of good movie fans grew up loving the seemingly artificial characters. But as everyone watched the end of the story in the silence of a fully occupied movie theater, the sentiment was clearly genuine. Most painfully, ""Avengers: The Finale"" hits the sense of nostalgia when every year the collaborative or solo films about familiar characters hit the screen. Now it's over, and like any good story, ""The Avengers"" has a proper ending. Viewers are united in a common sadness, as are half of the survivors on Earth in ""The Finale."" The final ""Avengers"" movie will show that strength is in brotherhood and love, especially when the characters say the famous ""Avengers, the general gathering!"" for the first and last time.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"In my opinion is not a good movie or a bad movie, is somewhere in the middle. I found the movie predictable, for example the scene to get the soul stone, it was obvious that black widow will be the one to die, because at the beginning of the movie, they try to give you a connection with Hawkeye by losing his family. Other example will be that their main characters like iron man will have a epic ending by dying or getting something they always wanted like capitan america.

Final I have to say that the only good part of the movie is the action scene when you see all the superheroes in action. You can miss the fist hour of the movie and it wouldn't matter because is easy to explain, is enough to say that they went back in time for the infinity stones, they force thing when they go back in time to build a story.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"This is the first film I've watched from the marvel franchise, and it's very disappointing. The visuals looked like they were done by a 12 year old (very CGI heavy, as of which was awful) and the plot is far too complicated. It excludes those who haven't watched all the previous films before this one, especially in the time travel scenes, which were arguably the weakest parts of this film. There are also many other scenes that are either too slow, or don't make sense which significantly added to the length of this film. The action scenes saw little improvement - they were drawn out and any individual battles taking place were practically impossible to see. Captain Marvel must be the worst actor I've ever seen, and Spiderman looks like someone they've dragged out of secondary school. The popularity and success of this film is really difficult to justify - perhaps the audience are none the wiser and lack the viewing of good quality films. This is the first film I've seen where it feels refreshing to see the end credits. I would not recommend the marvel franchise, unless you enjoy a good endurance challenge.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"Its important to understand that this is and will always be a blockbuster Disney movie - its not suppose to forever change cinema. I got what I wanted and nothing more, theres nothing bad in that of course.

I think that the main actors did a pretty good job, the emotional scenes in the end worked fairly well. However a lot of scenes felt very rushed. I am aware that in three hours a franchise spanning for over 10 years was getting its closure, but it really ruined some scenes specially in the beginning.

A lot of the plot points were happening because of stupid coincidences like Hulk getting down the stairs the exact moment, that was a load of bs. It was funny, I guess but it was stupid. I have that problem with every Marvel films the humour. It really hurts scenes that are suppose to make you chocked or sad. This movies is filled with these three liners and it gets repetitive very fast.

Overall fun movie I dont regret watching but will not watch again. Mostly because of the run time but yeye",3
Avengers: Endgame,"I waited years to finally watch this along with the 40 other marvel films and wow, they strip mined the avengers and marvel films for every single pebble of value that they could for a decade straight only to start with heroes and end up with plastic action figures boxed and ready to ship to the nearest toy isle. Every single marvel movie ends the same, every avenger movie ends the same, and every movies plot is the same as the other, but if you dress it up enough, cram a ton of advertising down people's throats, and then isolate people from anything else by controlling the industry, through buying up and shelving competition, I. E. Monopolizing the entire movie industry as to mitigate the amount of competition that exists around Disney, only to create a halfa$$ theme park that people will pay ridiculous money for so they can stand in line for hours for a 2 minute VR experience they could've just had at home; if there was more VR companies and less monopolies they probably could've saved a ton of money. But now they can just control the release dates of every other film company, so no need to worry about quality or consumer experience. Just make that money!",3
Avengers: Endgame,So many plot holes and inconsistencies it's not even funny. Characters that were inconsistent with their powers. Killing off main characters. Captain America goes back and changes the past to satisfy his dream and changes the whole time line resulting in others not exsisting at all like agent carters daughter. The movie was way to dark and no magic like the other films. It has ruined the whole franchise with the whole women empowerment gig. It has Disney written all over it. Well we can always look forward to some other production company coming up with new and exciting characters for us to watch.,3
Avengers: Endgame,"Easy shots by skilled players make this a fairly disappointing finale to arguably one of the most depressing set-ups in action film history.

While not fully predictable, there certainly aren't any surprises. Plot points were easily filed under ""sure. Why not.""

Heavy handed, almost disingenuous, with it's moral platitudes; the film couldn't muster any real investment in it's characters' developments. It had to rely on cheap TV drama level sentimentality. Requisite emasculation and patronizing feminism negated each other. It basically felt like the producers just don't know any, or even worse, like any actual humans.

Oh. Pacing was tortuous. You're going to see it anyway, though. So have fun.

Bonus points for ID-ing the purposeful use of satanic imagery at the end of the movie. Why. Just why.....?",3
Avengers: Endgame,"Who the ever living f%&# thinks that making a movie this way is ever going to be worth re-watching? A good movie is rewatchable without much context, this one though? It's a slog. Like the leto-joker film. A slog, an unavoidable slog film that you only see because your mates are going out to see it and hype the snot out of it and you somehow got invited and wanna go cause it's mad hype bro. And you didn't see the 20 other movies required to watch this one and understand it (I'm not joking). F^&^% this movie F342535 this franchise and F4525 whoever the hell thought this is a good idea. I officially and unoquivocally hate you, your mom and your fruits.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"Hulk? Barely fought and not even a rematch between him and Thanos The villains? Killed without breaking a sweat even though they were near invincible in Infinity War Thor? As an obese? Nah. Not working. Thanos himself? Just a super villain. You didn't have any sympathy for him as you did in Infinity War. His whole character was gone

Lastly, much of the humor was low-grade.. infinity war is by far the best og the 4 movies",3
Avengers: Endgame,"Worst Marvel movie made. For those of you who gave it anything higher than a 3 are either knuckleheads or don't know anything about the Avengers. CGI was cool, only reason I gave a 3. All the hype of Cpt. Marvel and she is in the movie for 5 minutes. Worse than Infinity War, which also sucked. Movie made no sense.",3
Avengers: Endgame,Would i say this a well made movie? Yes. Would I say it's well acted? Yes. Would I say it lived up to the hype when it came out? Yes...and No. This movie just didn't hit it for me. I wanted to like it a lot! But I ended up just coming out the theater just kinda disappointed that it really wasn't that good.,3
Avengers: Endgame,Infinity war is better than this. Because its a 3 hour long ride and nothing new in this movie.,3
Avengers: Endgame,"Didn't need a single other character in The marvel universe with as powerful as they made Carol Danvers aka Capn Marvel. She could have done everything solo, so this made this movie a 3 star instead of an 8. The movie lost all credibility by having a relatively new character for this series fly to the rescue. Boring....",3
Avengers: Endgame,"I'm not a big super hero fan, but love the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, and read that I needed to see a couple of Avengers movies before I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3,in order to be fully up to speed as to what had gone on in the intervening years.

So, I watched Avengers Infinity War, and absolutely loved it, superb film that had me on the edge of my seat and I felt completely involved and was drained by the end of it.

The next night I settled down to watch Avengers Endgame, and erm..

What the heck happened? I found this boring, choppy, confusing and way too long. I was constantly looking at the clock wondering how much longer was left of this borefest. There could have been 30 minutes easily removed from this film if not more.

Then, in the last hour things improved and there was some excitement, but by then, it was too late to care.

Oh well, at least I've got Guardians 3 to look forward to.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"Nothing to say a pop corn movie, marvel must to create R category movie",3
Avengers: Endgame,"I'm so over the marvel cash cow. I've seen it all, I've heard it all, I'm done. There is nothing new, groundbreaking, or original here and this is the movie that sent me over the edge. It was visually stunning which was one redeeming factor for me. But gosh am I hard pressed to find any others. I will not be going to any more marvel movies, avengers or otherwise.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"Acting: 8/10, A-list actors putting on great performances.

CGI: 9/10, Gargantuan effort, a small nation of highly talented and competent people putting in an absurd amount of time to make this movie possible.

Shot Composition: 6/10, Nothing too interesting or groundbreaking, but serviceable.

Direction: 5/10, The effort required to direct a monster this huge with a production team this vast is truly commendable. The aforementioned shot composition selection does bring the score down a bit, but not as much as...

Writing: 1/10, Rotten to its very core, the foundations of this film's writing are shaky at best.

Unfortunately, you can have all the fun and cool pretty lights, big shot actors, and fan service all you want, but this does not a great film make. Writing is, and always will be, at the forefront of good storytelling, regardless of the medium. The fact that this movie is rated above some of the greatest movies of all time really irks me, but I understand why many people like it.

There truly are some great scenes in this movie, but they have to be taken out of context with the rest of movie in order to be truly enjoyable as most of these scenes require acute contrivances and/or broken plot fundamentals in order to facilitate them happening in the first place. This entire movie needed to be re-written at the base level as it not only squanders many of the potential for different character's growth from Infinity War (or leaves previously interesting characters flat and lifeless), but also many payoffs don't have sufficient build up so as to leave them either unsatisfying or just plain confusing. The climax feels more cynical than anything else, writing/direction staff knew what cards to play to achieve the highest fan level excitement, and they did so, regardless of contrivance or character motivation. And to cap it off, the lack of consequences in this film is palpable, contrary as to what was portrayed in the previous entry Infinity War.

I do understand that at its core, this movie's (and every other MCU title or blockbuster) goal is to make money, first and foremost. Not only that, but this movie was also made to expand the MCU so they could potentially generate even more blockbuster hits. My problem is, that one could do that, and also make a great story, interesting plot, fantastic characters, etc. However, it seems that the production team instead opted use kiddie gloves with the audience and pursue cheap dopamine hits to maximize fan excitement and get butts in seats. Unfortunately for the greater art of storytelling, it worked. I watched this movie once, and I have not, or will revisit it. It is simply not worth the time.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"After two hours of absolutely nothing happening, I walked away. A complete and utter waste of time and money. How long do you expect me to wait for SOMETHING to happen?",3
Avengers: Endgame,I don't know. I don't like it much. I think because after infinity war i expected much more from marvel! And i liked infinity war very very much.,3
Avengers: Endgame,As we all know infinity war was so good and we all expected that endgame will be a movie higher than infinity war standards but it failed instead it was slow and depressing movie expect the last 30 mins of the movie.,3
Avengers: Endgame,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the Marvel franchise over the past 13 or so years. I liked some movies better than others of course but still can't think of one I didn't watch at least twice. Endgame disappointed me. It was long, and boring. The time travel aspect was not at all believable, funny thing to say I know considering this is a movie about superheros but that's my take. Finally, the epic battle at the end had been done before much better in Ultron. Time to put this baby to bed. It had a good run though.",3
Avengers: Endgame,History tries to impose on me a drama that does not convince me. This leaves tedious several parts of the movie.,4
Avengers: Endgame,"Let me start off my saying that I'm a true marvel fan. I've seen them all, own them all, frequently watch them all in order. I even went to opening night for this one as I have for many. At first watch, I loved the epic ness of it. That final fight had some serious LOTR vibes about it and I dug it. But then as I sat in the car afterward, I just felt disappointed. There were so many questions and letdowns. The actress for Ant Mans adorable daughter won't be back because now she's grown up, the world is apparently in chaos, people's loved ones come back but they're spouses may have remarried, passed in, people may have committed suicide, and don't even get me started on falcon becoming CA. I loved the massiveness of the story, especially for Tony to get a big end, but it just didn't do all these years justice. Also, Tony and Steve totally deserved a boromir/Aragorn goodbye. All in all, I didn't love it. Could have been way better for the expectation. Basically, a lot of messiness was created all for the sake of giving iron man a kid. Unnecessary and I've seen better.",4
Avengers: Endgame,I'll be in the minority in that I didn't enjoy it. I'm not a huge marvel fan but having to watch 20 odd movies beforehand and keep track of the on-going storyline is a bit much,4
Avengers: Endgame,"The end of an era as fans might say and to which I say ""I agree."" With that said it was a failed attempt at making history and ending up being garbage. I'll take nothing away from the acting nor the special effects and of course that portal scene. It was absolutely AMAZING!! As for the rest of the movie it was s**t. I can't believe that a rat saved the universe and say what you will about Tony Stark actually ""saving"" it, but you would be wrong and you are so suck it. Anyways, making Thor fat was a big mistake and ruined the character that just started to become iconic. In the final battle of the movie I was not in my seat with excitement more of dissatisfaction if anything and that is because it was such a one sided battle like seriously I felt they took a page out of Fairy Tail and made everyone that wasn't apart of the Avengers or heroes weak. I ""love"" the fact that there is only one hero who dies in the battle and it was really pointless because they could have just revived him with the Time Stone. The greatest weapon in the universe was tossed around like a game of Hot Potato what a shame. If nothing else kill Captain America as well as a few other heroes such as War Machine. Yes. Black Widow died, but it was less of a tole because she died the same way as Gamora a year prior and why did she die it should have been Hawkeye. He is such a complete waste of time in the MCU and it's clear that Marvel doesn't see him as a strong character. When you really think about it Black Widow is getting a movie while Hawkeye gets a TV Series. It shows who they like more and Widow it dead. Professor Hulk sucks. Thanks for ruining him Marvel!! The last thing that didn't sit well with me was dissing every single time traveling movie. In conclusion this movie should been a trilogy so that there could have been more built rather than something that felt to rush to the end and start on a new chapter. I like to think that it could have been like ""Lord of the Rings"" and what that trilogy accomplished and I don't think anyone would have complained about that. This movie is a joke.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"Just another dumb kids movie, with some tacked-on grrl power BS. Quite disappointing and unnecessarily overlong. I was surprised to see Supergirl make a cameo appearance, especially in a Marvel movie.

Something for the teens to get excited about, but a long 3 hours for any intelligent adult.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"Well! There are lots of good things about the film worth mentioning: VFX, lines, cinematography etc. Even the story itself was kind of good. However, the film was overwhelmed with PC and diversity factors and principals. And because of that the film has no soul ... seems something missing or something was no right! I am wondering if PC and Diversity ever stop ruining movies? It seems they won't stop unless they have already ruined and/or spoiled all the heroes we have had for decades.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"It was good and epic but not as epic as Infinity War. Thor and Hulk were huge disappointments. I wanted to see stronger and more badass Thor. But in this movie, he was rather fat and drunk. He didn't even fight well. Even Captain America was better than him with Mjölnir. Another thing is Thanos. He was more powerful in this movie even without the Infinity Gauntlet. The first 2 hours of the movie was boring and no action. Last hour was good, though. I liked the movie but it definitely doesn't deserve such high rating. 8 - 8,4 is enough.",4
Avengers: Endgame,I don't understand their logic it is so stupid. There are so many plot holes like when captain america did not return the future should change that is what they also stated if the the past is changed the future will also change.,4

Avengers: Endgame,"This doesn't feel like the avengers.

The characters all change their vibe (excluding ant man and capT America). It was trying to be funny and not at all pulling it off. It's backdrop was boring. It was mute and dull the whole time. The one action scene was a copy and paste of previous movies, with 4 second cameos for each avenger. The dialogue was unbelievable. Thor.... what a let down. It was funny at first but he should have sprung back into the broody hero he is instead of sooking throughout the entire film. It was so long, so unnecessarily long. So many scenes didn't need to be there. The hulk was just a pain to watch. I want to see banner and the hulk, not a weird combination of the two throughout the entire film. Plot holes GALORE! What a disappointing end to an otherwise awesome franchise.

The stars I've given are for CGI, the few funny moments and Paul Rudd.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"Too loud in the theater and not a good film. Sorry It all starts out promising. Setting things up and being as good humoured as usual. But then the time travelling stuff sets in. At first it sounded like this was going to be fun. But as it marched on it felt like way to much was being thrown in there, and the entire story (and a few of the previous movies) seem to get trashed in the chaos. I love time travel movie's if they setup some rules and stick to them. But do alot of contradicting stuff and you lose me. Still. There are a few surprises, and the big finale is still amazing to look at. The Ending does seem fitting, but the stink from the middle part of the movie stays throughout, and i was left scratching my head at least a couple of times more with revelations at the end. Oh, and I'm not sure what I think about the hulk in this.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and fellow hemorrhoid sufferers around the world, it's time for a review of a movie that's been hailed as a cinematic masterpiece but left me feeling more uncomfortable than sitting on a bed of nails with a hemorrhoid flare-up. I'm talking about none other than Avengers: Endgame.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of superhero movies, but this one just didn't do it for me. The storyline felt forced, the pacing was all over the place, and the humor was more cringe-worthy than a hemorrhoid exam.

Sure, the special effects were top-notch, and the action scenes were impressive, but that doesn't excuse the lackluster plot and character development. And let's not forget about the three-hour runtime that left me feeling like I needed a tube of hemorrhoid cream just to make it through to the end.

The acting was decent, but with such a large ensemble cast, it felt like some characters were just there for the sake of being there. And the time-travel plotline felt like a cop-out that only served to tie up loose ends in a messy and unsatisfying way.

In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a movie that falls short of its hype. If you're looking for a superhero flick that will leave you feeling entertained and satisfied, then this is not it. But if you're looking for a movie that will leave you feeling more uncomfortable than a hemorrhoid flare-up, then give it a watch. Just make sure you have plenty of hemorrhoid cream and tissues handy. This movie is a disappointing example of what can happen when a franchise loses its way.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"I think this film was good but it missed the mark for me, it also was all of the place as a story and had a few plot holes which a story of this magnitude shouldn't have it is the epic conclusion of 11 years and 22 films not just another marvel movie.

Things I didn't like. Fat Thor was an absolute joke and has turned a character who is the MIGHTY THOR who is supposed to look strong and incredible into a joke, he shouldn't look like someone like me with a gut and man boobs.

Professor Hulk felt dumb and douchy which neither Hulk or Banner is so I dont see why the two together was.

Pepper in her own Iron man suit felt forced and pointless and like they were just trying to have another strong female superhero which for me doesn't work if it doesn't feel organic like all the other female superheroes in the MCU. Also although it's in the comics there hasn't really been anything of Pepper wearing a suit and she was a strong female character without it so it just wasnt needed.

Captain Marvel was pretty pointless, she didn't add anything to the story and came across as really arrogant which sucked because she was great in her own film (the film itself was questionable) and also we were led to believe that she was going to play a huge role in defeating Thanos which she just didn't do.

Falcon getting the mantle of Captain America I felt was deserved because we've only seem Sam as the comic sidekick character and not the leader character that Captain America needs to be so again it just felt forced and like it was being done for diversity reasons which for me takes away from the character because theres a lack of organic ness to it. Dont get me wrong I'm 1000% for more female and ehtic minority characters but it needs to feel organic and not like it's just forced in there and forced in your face we need to look at characters and just be like oh shes strong and not be told oh shes strong.

There was too much humour that took away from the seriousness of what was trying to be achieved in the story and bow for some reason we've got non comic relief characters making jokes that are out of character and fall flat, it just feels like they're all trying to out dad joke each other which when everything is at steak makes no sense for everyone to just be having a laugh.

I felt the final battle was lacking and should've been much bigger.

Things I liked were. Iron man sacrificing himself i thought it was a great way to end his story and had the right emotion to it.

Captain America getting Thor's hammer was my favourite part personally. Also when he was stood there alone ready to take on the whole army and everyone came back was great.

Black widow sacrificing herself for Hawkeye who is basically her brother and his family was really emotional but good.

But overall I think they really missed the mark with this film which is so sad also because the Russo brothers films are probably my favourite in the whole MCU, I feel like when the hype dies down people will realise oh wait thay wasnt as good as we thought which is also sad.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"I watched Endgame twice. And both times, something just wasn't sitting right with me. The jokes generally landed, the fan service was everywhere, and it seemed like everything generally was wrapped up, even if Thanos was strangely overpowered without the Gauntlet and Captain Marvel's Deus Ex Machina appearance was cheap. It was, while no 10/10 amazing art piece (and of course it wasn't, it was never supposed to be), a seemingly solid blockbuster, with a huge, unstoppable marketing machine and legions of ravenous fans, hungry for more.

All movies, irregardless of whether they set out to do so or not, have something to say. It's the same of all art. As human beings, we absorb messages given to us by these art pieces, even if they were designed 'merely' as simple entertainment. In the world we live in, we're eager to forfeit choice, and in doing so, we forfeit responsibility. I liked Infinity War because it taught the Avengers something. It taught not only the Avengers, but should have taught the audience as well - heroes can't win every time. It's impossible. The Avengers, irregardless of their status, have lost, and we as a world, and they too, had to live with that. Endgame's message is cheap and rather disheartening. The Avengers, instead of trying to live with their mistakes, are portrayed as people who'd rather cling on to the past and to their past failures. Tony Stark is the only character in the film who has accepted what has happened and moved on. In real life, there's no opportunity to go back and correct one's mistakes - we have to live with them. There's no 'save, reload' function, no time travel button. The Avengers, rather than showing their strengths as admirable heroes who'd press on despite their losses, try to reverse their mistake, and despite their best efforts, doom several other realities to chaos or even destruction. They are confident at the beginning of the movie, eager to win against Thanos, but when they find that their loss cannot be reversed, they can't accept it. For five years, they grieve - as does the world. Where is the human spirit of endeavor? During history, people have always stood back up from tragedy and done their best to rebuild. That's what we do as human beings. Avengers: Endgame presents a flawed philosophy - it's the mistakes in the past that matter, not the choices in the future. In choosing the past, we absolve our responsibility for the future, and damn... that's dangerous.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"Like any other Marvel movie, this one is also very mediocre. If you have watched all the others and are with the HYPE, then you definitely want to watch this. However, keep in mind that this movie is very average. The music is nothing special, camerawork is very normal and the script is very cheesy and predictable. This movie is also very long and it doesn't have to be. I will probably forget this movie in a month or two.",4
Avengers: Endgame,It made a lot of money and that's this concludes my review,4
Avengers: Endgame,"As (everybody) knows, Disney are too interested in franchise-based continuum and wide audience ""four quadrant"" sales to actually do anything creative, and the monopoly owns, schedules and legally deploys over half of what appears at ""the movies"" these days.

So they created this film - which, whether they wanted it or not, just solidifies why so many people dislike Superhero Movies in the CGI era.

1) The film has no heart. Literally plays as an ad for previous installments, features a winding plot about goodies vs baddies and GUESS what happens at the end?

2) Downey Jr takes home about 50 mil in global residuals and fees while some 60,000 people outside in LA live in tents, have no basic water or sanitation.

3) Film is actually the product of previous installations to milk the Avengers like putting a cow thru a blender. Why not create three concise, successful films (like the original Star Wars or Lord of the Rings trilogy) that are equally mainstream, and has a sense of heart, emotion and inspiration? The characters were getting so overfamiliar by the time this umpteenth sequel rolled around, I felt somewhat stale and weary before even going into the cinema.

4) Chris Pratt.",4
Avengers: Endgame,I give you a 6 for thanos. The little that comes out takes the film.,4
Avengers: Endgame,"Overall a good movie, felt like Infinity War and two previous Avenger movies were better, not as rushed. There were many holes in the internal story for Endgame, could have been pushed out to two 2-hour movies to help fill in some questions.

In general I was pleased but without giving away spoilers and movie details it's a movie to check out for all fans and want a good 3-hr experience at the theatre.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"Okay, I was about 12 when Iron Man hit theaters back in 2008 and I thought it was awesome and I kind of had a bit of an on/off relationship with the MCU - I mean I expect people to disagree with me on this but the only decent movie out of phase 2 in my opinion was Captain America Winter Soldier. But after this became the highest grossing movie of all time I decided to catch up and see if it was worth it. As this is the highest grossing film of all time and there's about 20 films worth of backstory for this I'd honestly rather not dive into the plot and things like that as either you've seen it or you won't.

Right onto the stuff I like, I treated this as a series finale to a TV Show for some aspects and I actually think it delivers a satisfying conclusion to all of the characters. It's not easy to do that in a satisfying way for many, many characters and I'll give credit where and when it's due. I also really liked the bits in the first act where they deal with the grief of what Thanos did in Infinity War. Each one deals with it differently and each worked.

Now onto the more controversial opinions of this movie. The main gist of what happens is that the surviving heroes find a way to go back in time to undo what Thanos did in Infinity War for their own gem collecting - okay, fine. My problem is that they establish that they can't change what happens in their past. It's the only rule for time travel given and they literally ignore it by doing what they do in the film. I mean the argument could be made that they said they'll put the stones back immediately after undoing what Thanos did but Thanos also gets wind of this despite it not being in any of the films beforehand and past Thanos travels to the present to stop them but Iron Man kills him - more stuff that makes no sense. It's literally the focal point of the entire plot.

Now onto another point of the plot which is also kind of a complaint with Infinity War but no matter, I'll bring it up here - Thanos' plan is moronic. I get that what they're going for is a more sympathetic look at him and not the guy who did those things because he wants a romantic relationship with The Grim Reaper but if with no warning half of Earth (just Earth) got snapped away then cars would have no drivers, planes would have no pilots and economies would pretty much crash as a result. Causing way more death and starvation than doing nothing to combat overpopulation - I mean Thanos literally says in Infinity War that it's completely random. I mean I know he takes out half the universe in the comics and introducing The Grim Reaper would be a bit out of nowhere, I admit both these things however I really think ""The universe is overpopulated so I'll kill half the universe with a magic glove that can control said universe"" just really doesn't work.

As a way to say goodbye to the majority of heroes who appeared in the MCU previously this satisfies on that front but my problem with it is that the entire story save for the first act where they're trying to recover, before the time travel thing gets introduced is really not satisfying and considering this is the longest MCU film and that it wraps up everything the overwhelming feeling I get from this is exhaustion. There is good here but while I like previous MCU films this big crossover feels less like wanting more out of it and more like I need to take a break from the series and play catch-up again.",4
Avengers: Endgame,This was a entertaining film that did its job and nothing more than that and really there's not that much to say about it. I am a fan of the comics and used to be a big fan of the movies until they just became kind of forgettable. Also there are a lot of plot holes in it but if you wanna here about those I recommend a film review channel called yms that describes it. Anyway go see it if your a fan.,4
Avengers: Endgame,"So - it's trash. Cap is like top 5 least useful avengers. If Thor wasn't drunk and if Captain Marvel made it onto the screen during the last two hours if would have been a very short movie. Time travel sucks. So basically if anyome wants to get into MCU just watch this trash and it will be like you watched it all cause nothing really happened from the movies before because of time travel. Still a 4, i liked the asguardians of the galaxy pun",4
Avengers: Endgame,"I was so excited to watch the movie in theaters, i jumped in with my family. I was hoping some heroic performances. However, the end was just so pathetic. The story of reborn/reincarnation of villain was just like what?

I personally did not like the story of the film. It is just a gimmick compared to other films in MCU. However, i liked Avengers, end war more than this. But simply it is JUST OVER.

I liked the iron man specialy in Avengers series, but this movie was not like I thought of. The Avengers series start was really superb, with a theme and powerpacked performance. But I don't know what happened in this specific movie, the movie plot is not so powerful.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"This one puts drama at an unprecedented level. This is supposed to be a super-hero movie, not a soap opera. Too much story and the action only had 30 or so minutes. I wasted my money on this.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,Waste of time. Didn't understand Whether Thanos is Hero or the Averages. I think the Storywriter is himself confused.,1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Thor's story was good, the rest was the usual crappy stereotypes. Too much CGI, 3rd rate acting by most characters. Mindless entertainment, lots of eye candy, forgettable movie.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"While Infinity Wars was graphically entertaining, the story was way off que compared to the comic books. This movie boiled down to Star Lord helping pull the gaunlet off to save humanity or punching Thanos and he chose the later, which made no sense, making him the cause of all the death... please read the comic book and stick to the story when you make a movie.. you shame marvel comics.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"1. I think this plot was really uncreative, especially compared to Civil War or Winter Soldier... or really any other recent Marvel movie. I ADMIT its amazing to see ALL these superheroes together, I enjoyed their dialogue, and the simultaneous battles were cool, but its wasted on a pointless, lazy plot. Bad guy gonna kill (50% of) everyone. Wow. 2. Why does Thanos care anyway? How does killing 50% of the universe make him feel any better about the fall of his own planet/society? Even Loki's pettiest motives were more solid than Thanos'. Also, why did he ""love"" his ""adopted"" (abducted) daughter more than his blood daughter? 3. This is colonial-imperialist propaganda. Usually Marvel films seem to me critical of the military-industrial complex. But this film promotes the idea that because of the failings of ONE LIFESTYLE - mass industrial society - all forms of life are unsustainable. Not everyone lives like a spoiled American/ect. Some people actually take responsibility for supporting themselves and dont depend on slave-labor from others. Some people don't dump their excess in landfills and oceans. 4. That ending was just cruel and unnecessary for MCU fans. 5. Thor didn't even show any skin. Does he charge extra or what? Thats the least I deserve for enduring that. 6. I'm no prude, but the profanity seems out of place. Who is their target audience? I'm 28, no kids, but it still just felt inappropriate and tacky, for cheap laughs. 7. I hate the MCU post-credit scenes. Just put it all together. If theyre that desperate for us to watch the credits, just play awesome music.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"The whole connection between the actors telling the story felt awkward, rehearsed, at this leve, knowing that 2018 saw a paradigm change but not yet shift, it felt under made...kinda lazy on production side of things is what I'm trying to say",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"The movie was average, nothing out of the ordinary. Marvel has already set the standard for the superhero movie and clearly doesn't plan on antagonizing the cash-flow formula of it's success. I will never understand the Black Panther lure and I don't consider it to be a legitimate superhero...and I've tried. Also bored with Evans as he just cannot act. Everything else was well done.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"This movie was horrible! I'm not upset because everyone died, I'm upset because the climax sucked horribly.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Inconsistent film, it only represents a great marketing campaign, passenger, it is not something that remains in memory.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Don't get me wrong. The movie is great and all, but is it just me that nobody cares about any of the genocide that has happened in the world and is still happening today, but as soon as it happens a movie it's the greatest thing since sliced bread? Pretty pathetic excuse for a human race we are to say genocide in a movie is wrong but still let it happen in real life. Do we get to see all of the murdered native americans return to life as well or just all the white people who died in the movie?",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"I never appreciated movies like this, superhero movies have less material of inteligence contained than horror movies, at least horror provides a view into psychology and religion.

Movie was 3 hours long, and 3 hours of logical torture, never was I ever convinced that the so called Marvel Industry can create a film like that of the Batman series by Christopher Nolan (excuse me if the name ain't correct), which though being in itself a superhero movie, had little to no unlogical and unreasonable technology or as I prefer it Fantasy stashed in.

To put such a movie on the top 250 list for IMDB is simply a big fat mistake, every single movie that proceeds it is better.

One opinion: The death of iron man is such a GOOD thing, since it freed robert d and let him go on to play a leading role in Christopher Nolan's masterpiece Oppenhiemer. Marvel should only create comics. Nothing more.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,Must have paid so many people to write good reviews on this one. Pure and utter garbage!!!!,1
Avengers: Infinity War,"I wish Marvel would stop. I'm done with the cartoonish CGI, poor action scenes and weak plots. I was so bored I started skipping scenes to get to the end. Horrible movie.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,All my favourites died if they don't come back in the next one I will never watch another marvel movie again so help me god,1
Avengers: Infinity War,Such a big pile of... Is the viewer really supposed to relate to Thanos? Like really? His intentions and sacrifices were anything but touching. I'm so glad I didn't spend any cash to see it in the cinema.,1
Avengers: Infinity War,"If you thought the Russo movies was making a serious movie after they made Winter Soldier and Civil War, think again. This is just another Joss Whedon movie with crappy jokes and one liners throughout the entire movie. Also some of the characters I liked the most were underutilized in the movie like Captain America and Black Panther. Instead they focused on the Guardians, Thor, Iron Man, Spider Man, Doctor Strange, and Hulk. All these characters were full of crappy jokes and one liners in a movie that's about a mad titan trying to destroy half of the universe

Also, the actions scenes were disappointing. There were some pretty impressive action scenes like Hulk vs Thanos and Iron Man/Spider Man/Doctor vs Thanos in the end. But there's really not a single action scene that is as memorable as the highway fight scene in Winter Soldier or the airport fight scene in Civil War. Most of the action scenes were people just flying back and explosions and it almost felt like a Transformers movie sometimes. Another strange thing about the action scenes is that when it would get really good it would cut into another scene somewhere else.

Thanos by far is easily the best thing in the movie. He actually has depth to him and his scenes with Gamora were some of the strongest scenes in the movie. He also didn't say stupid jokes like Ultron did and was mostly serious for the whole movie which is a huge plus. I did laugh in the end though when he snapped his fingers and people were turning to ash, it was so overly dramatic that I chuckled when some of the characters disappeared. The other villains which I believed are the Black Order all looked like villains from a Warcraft game, all cgi and they looked stupid except for Ebony Maw who died too quickly.

All in all, this should have a been a much more serious movie along like the lines of Winter Soldier and Civil War and most of the actions scenes had too much going on with stupid jokes that undermined the tension of it. The story also wasn't really that good except for Thanos's character who was so good that I was rooting for him instead of the stupid sitcom characters known as the Avengers.Very disappointing movie.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Sad and depressing movie, made my day ruined, I really don't know why people were so hyped for this lol",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"What the hell? When we grow up, we been taught that: Good always wins over evil, Kindness always wins... Good will always prevail... Be good to others.. Always be kind... Pray for those who need it... and blah, blah blah. This movie is really f* up (pardon my French), Thanos is a homicidal/genocidal maniac and yet the movie tried to depict him as some kind of hero or god on a mission. Hulk is just like a sad clown trying to be funny but so pathetic, I guess because the idiot director from Thor Ragnarok made him that way therefore the 2 idiots directed this movie carry on the same path. Like one of the reviewers commented, we go see superheroes to feel good, seeking escapism. We wish to have someone like Ironman, Spiderman, Captain America to right the wrongs, to seek justice for all, to protect the weaks and so on which doesn't exist in real life. And my 11 year old son adore them all (all the Marvel heroes), and I made a BIG mistake by taking him to see this sorry-ass movie, and it brokes his heart. It not nice at all to see all your idols get their ass kicked left and right throughout the movie then get killed at the end. Then... hang around waiting for the credit to end to watch some last segment of the movie indicate and left the movie theatre with some vague hope that ""part 2"" (which won't be out until next year) that something will happen to justify all this heart-breaking nonsense. He is so sad that he told me today to give away all his bluray collection of Ironman, Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy. That would tell you something huh? I will not pay to see the next instalment of this crap and that a promise.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Depressing? Check. Zero plot? Check. Do I want to use my free time to enjoy a depressing movie as a form of entertainment? No.

I can sum up this movie in a few lines:

1)We are getting the band back together.

2)CGI mess

3)No twist, nothing special. Very linear.

4)Every one of your heros just suck not using their main strengths

5)Make every hero stupid and fail.

6)Over dramatized for not caring about the heros because they are that dumb.

Pretty much just hand over the stones and die. Thanks for the multi billion dollars for this poor developed story and movie.

Anyone that tells you, ""it's good"" is for sure lying and just hyping it just what the business wants. Seriously, not good. I've seen all the Marvel movies and this one is just action follow by drama garbage. Can you guys just make another 'Winter solider' movie? I really don't mind waiting a over a year for the next one to rent it on Netflix with the dribble I just saw. I gave it a one because I just felt like I saw nothingness and stupidity at it's finest.

The end.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"If you wanted a review from someone with nice things to say about Infinity War, then you came to the wrong place. What do I not dislike about this film? I suppose some of the jokes land and actually that's pretty much it. First of all, it's far too infinite a war. The Avengers, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Revengers, in fact pretty much everyone aside from Ant-Man and Hawkeye appears in this movie and features in an extremely prominent role. That is far too many protagonists to have to follow.

(The movie also follows suit the example of Spider-Man: Homecoming in making Peter Parker into Robin instead of Spider-Man which thankfully was rectified by No Way Home but was in full force here.) Speaking of which, Spider-Man's death scene wasn't a particularly well-executed one.

And it's an unfortunate reality that the Marvel Cinematic Universe lowered our standards for villains enough that Thanos qualifies as a great one instead of merely a decent one.

With Valentine from Kingsman: The Secret Service, a supervillain with the same motivation of Thanos was much better done. Valentine is an eco-terrorist whose neo-Malthusian alarmism and paranoia lead to him seeking to cull the world's population because he views humanity as a virus and global warming as a fever. Yet Valentine also can't stomach gore and therefore relies extensively upon his henchmen so as to enable himself to avoid seeing the violence and while he is genre-savvy enough to kill the local James Bond pastiche by shooting him dead, he's still disturbed as he does this. As a result he works quite well as a villain in stark contrast to Thanos.

For context, Thanos repeatedly forced his adoptive daughters Gamora and Nebula to fight half to death and punished the loser by amputating her limbs and replacing them with metal prosthetics resulting in Nebula becoming more machine than humanoid and Gamora being rewarded for it with employment as an assassin in his service (the original purpose for which he salvaged her from her home-world after butchering it.) That's abuse, plain and simple. Yet the movie still characterizes Thanos as truly loving Gamora, though not Nebula. And it's inconsistent in its efforts to deny or embrace Thanos's sadism from earlier films. In Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos killed his own right-hand man out of pique and threatened to soak the Milky Way in Ronan's blood should Ronan fail him. And while there are some aspects of this film (such as his treatment of Nebula and of the Dwarf King) which are entirely consistent with his sadism most of the movie attempts to emphasize that Thanos isn't a sadistic brute. And I can actually live with Thanos's demographic paranoia being utter nonsense (which it is) given he's supposed to be a villain but his monologuing in practically every scene he's in about his motivation and plan actually grows quite tiresome by the end of the film.

And the ending could hardly have been worse. In the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail, at the end of the film King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are arrested by anachronistic police before they get the Grail thus ending the film. Eric Idle, who wrote that ending, characterized it as the worst ending any movie ever had. He was wrong. The ending to Infinity War is the worst.

Dr. Strange said that if he were forced to choose between Iron Man and Robin (sorry, Iron Man and Spidey) or the Infinity Stones he would protect the stones. But after looking into all possible futures and finding one to stop Thanos, Strange readily gives up the Infinity Stone because it's ""the only way"" while Thanos gets off scot free and in the post-credits scene Fury signals Captain Marvel to negate the events of the film.

I could also rant about Iron Man's character regressing though that was honestly business as usual by this point or about Hulk being easily defeated and Banner being turned into a joke or the fact that Thor's arc in this movie goes nowhere (and I don't mean the space station) or that Star-Lord has turned into a light-weight or any of the other myriad problems this movie had. But if I did that, I would likely never stop ranting about it. If you liked this movie that's entirely fine. Enjoy it to your heart's content. But I do not for a moment share your high regard for it. I despise this film.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,Don't get me wrong I adored this movie I was obsessed with it for months but endgame kinda ruined it. The Russo's easily could've made a 4th avengers movie while not reversing the events of infinity war. They could've just killed off all the hero's that already had their 3 movies and kept all the ones who still had more movies alive but nope they went the sell out way.,1
Avengers: Infinity War,I'd like to say I don't understand how anyone could like this except I know how much people lack empathy for characters or just enjoy being upset. I personally don't. And i dread every movie with hero crossovers as they supersede anything that could have mattered from one of the stand alones. I don't get invested in super hero stuff because of movies like this. Hope everyone likes their soap opera in tights.,1
Avengers: Infinity War,Everyone dies. The joy of super hero movies is the triumph over evil.. this has none of that. This is bad guy spends entire movie ripping out audiences' hearts.,1
Avengers: Infinity War,"I can summarize how dumb this movie is embarrassingly easily.

Premise: The premise of this movie is collecting the stones, one of which is the mind stone in possession of vision. The ""bad"" guy want's it because it is powerful enough to be a universe level threat, yet the impossibly advanced, fantasicaly over the top robot that is in possesion of said power is so weak he get's manhandled by grunts.

""Ethos"": This one is in quotes because it is a statement made multiple times throughout the movie yet contradicted in every single act. The ""good"" guys say ""We don't trade lives"", yet throughout the movie proceed to sacrifice half of all life to save one and sacrifice thousands of mortal troops to protect above mentioned useless robot, who is mere software and can be rebuilt at any time.

Power scaling: Marvel has never been known for it's consistency, but this movie is so dumb it cancels itself out multiple times per act. I will avoid naming characters to avoid spoilers, but a character who can't land a single hit on thanos in one act 2 minutes later comes closer to killing thanos than anybody else ever has. Another instance has a character getting thrown around by random, unnammed cgi grunts then single handedly destroys entire warships full of enemies.

Marvels lack of effort has become a meme, but this movie more than any other piece of cinema in existence embodies and demonstrates that it isn't just a baseless meme. From start to finish the movie is self contradicting in every discernable way, it contradicts itself in words, actions and ideology from the opening scene to the end credits and along the way has power levels fluctuate so massively that it renders every character as a joke, one specific example I can give of that is dr strange saying he looked into 14 million future timelines and saw only 1 way to defeat thanos, something which is directly contradicted by characters power levels in infinity war and is directly rendered moot by events in multiverse of madness. It genuinelly seems like marvel execs asked their children to scribble some drawings, not together, not in a play date scenario, just in their own homes completely seperate from each other to guarantee there wasnt a single consistent facet, brought those crayon scribbles into a meeting room and told a director to cobble a bunch of disjointed, incoherent drawings into a movie almost 3 hours long.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Infinity War was very predictable for us who read the comics, that is a small critic. Dinklage was out of place, Black Widow felt unnecessary, and Hulk was mistreated horribly. A lot of things was missing as well, and a few decisions did not really work.

With that said though it was fantastic entertainment, great movie experience, and top 5 marvel movie.

Also if you are a green party member and you want to kill humans because in your psychotic world there are too many people, you will love this movie beyond compare.

One of the most entertaining movies ever made and a fantastic superhero movie, but as a movie (in general) it had too many problems to get top grade.",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"Infinity War was clever. Endgame is just silly. You could write a novel about all that is wrong with it, but let's mention the most glaring examples: 1. Time travel. Never use it as a plot device. It becomes dumb, and removes any sense of consequence. It is basically a reset button. And Endgame takes the price for amount of self contradictions when clumsily making use of it. 2. Thanos was an interesting character in IW; here he is just a cartoon villan. 3. Everything with Thor. Ragnarok identified him as a true god of thunder; the hammer was just to focus his powers. And now suddenly Steve Rogers can call lightning? 4. Political correctness. Cap's main motivation for several movies has been his old pal Bucky, but now at the end it's suddenly black wing guy who gets the final moments with him and takes over the shield? I guarantee that was NOT the original plan. There's lots of PC in the movie, but this is the most glaring example. Another grating example is the whole presence of Captain Marvel; over-powerful, and yet useless. 5. Humor. In IW it was clever. Here it is mostly reduced to fart jokes. 6. Don't just copy yourself, Russos. The soulstone sacrifice in IW was moving. Here I could not care less. 7. Thanos, again. In IW a handful of Avengers almost defeated him when he had the glove and most of the stones; they only failed because of the emotional stakes (again, clever). Thor bested him after he got the whole thing. And in Endgame the whole lot of them, including supergirl cannot get in a good punch when his only weapon is a big axe?

There's tons more, but I'll pause at that. Final thoughts:

Infinity War was clever and more importantly full of tension, from the very first scene. Endgame was boring, and more that a little annoying. I found myself distracted by my phone whilst watching it, which only happens with really bad movies. What bothers me the most is that is makes a mockery of all the ground work laid down by the best of the Marvel movies; Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, Civil war, Infinity War.

It is comparable to Alien 3 after Aliens - there are good moments but you mostly want to un-see it.",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"Really bad but I wouldn't say the worst Avengers movie that title is for endgame, but this one is really bad itself. Disney does one thing really well ruined franchise",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"This movie is boring, without creativity and a stupid final...is just another faileure of dysney....one and another time...",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"First of starting with Loki dying. I had no problem if marvel decides to kill a character to show the strength of Thanos. But really Loki? With his past experience and his personality. He is obviously not going to randomly stab a monster planning to wipe out half of the people who is 5 times his size with a dagger (you can say im just an angry loki fan, but this logic is terrible). The more towards the end of the movie the more chaotic it gets. So many characters just get put in different scenes and skipping between scenes so rapidly made me completely lose track.

Just bad movie with no order, dont watch it unless you are going to watch endgame.",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"This is a very disappointing movie and a waste of time. Most MCU movies wrap up their plot in one film. This is just an excuse to make us watch a second movie, it breaks from MCU traditions, and I won't watch anymore of these films.",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"Only good thing that Russo brothers good at is the CGI .. realy poor story , I really hate when they make the villain a good man .. and why is gamora? Seriously?!",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"Too Star Trek: Next Generation for me.

My 5 year old son was bored. Sat's it all really.

A baffling mess.

What Hollywood has gained in special effects, it's lost in story telling and I know which one I prefer.

Avengers: Infinity War,"As if unleashing Surtur and watching him destroy Assplace , Assburg ..where ever was not bad enough a loss , whilst cruising on the Grandmasters ""SUV"" on their way to earth what was left of those who survived Hela , now get a visit from Thanos. After a rousing sermon it is discovered he wants the tesseract , and within it the infinity stone. Thor attempts to foil the plot but is bound to fail. Loki , in a final act of Heroism for his people attempts to kill Thanos but misses. A point Thanos drives home. Meanwhile , Hiemdall Decides this matter needs to be taken to lower authority and sends Hulk on a door dash for the Avengers. After which , Thanos reasserts his point. Back in New York City , Strange and Wong are engaged in a debate over the importance of meat , and the problems of the lack of money it requires. After Wong decides on a tuna melt , Banner crashes the party.

Thanos is coming. Wong and Strange ask the most important question of all. Who?

In Central Park , in his own world Tony Stark continues his life long project. Chasing Pepper Potts. It seems to go well with the marriage and kids chat and the kissing and flirting , But then something strange happens. Dr. Strange to be exact. Appearing in Central Park with Banner in tow. After a reminder from Pepper to be home before 10 pm , Tony returns to Bleecker street for the Wong's Notes version of the history of the infinity stones. After which Banner fills in the scary parts about Thanos being an insane being that travels the Galaxy killing half the people on any planet he pit stops at. Discussions on strategies are fruitless as arguing is reduced to the proper use of garbage disposals and ballon animals.

Banner in a good attempt to refocus the group attempts to call on Tony to re assemble the Avengers. Sadly his two year absence was showing. Tony breaks down the politics of the breakup. It takes a significant moment , but Stark sucks his ego up and grabs the phone the Captain left behind. Yet , oddly enough there is something wrong in the air , and it is not Strange's weave. The people outside engaged in vigorous running for their lives does not bode well.

On Bus on a bridge the problem seems clear , well at least to Peter Parker. The Ring has arrived. Sadly , this is not Master Chief. With distraction employed he slings off to the city to investigate. Stark with Banner and the Wizards of the East Coast in tow receives an all to familiar sermon. After politely refusing service and referring the Alien warmongers to the laws regarding proper business hours , the Aliens disregard and begin an assault. Stark calls for the big green one. Then comes the awkward moment where Banner explains that himself and the Hulk have done a little version of the avengers in his absence. Embarrassment aside Tony reaches in the bag for the Iron. Round one goes the right way and Tony shows off his new suit. The baddies are persistent and a prolonged fight looms. As Banner won't turn green Strange sends him to the Green of a nearby park. The baddies fight spills over to the city and again Banner still non hulked is in the thick again. Right on cue our friendly neighborhood Spider man arrives to ask whas up? The short end of it is he must now chase down a wizard with a necklace. Which of course leads to boarding Master Chei..uh...Thanos ship. After dropping off Parker , and informing Pepper dinner may be postponed Stark takes a look at his opponents joint. Parker a teenager of course ignores the adults and re enters the ship right before it jumps. Wong returns to the sanctum.

All Banner can think about is the amazing length Stark went to in order to not call the Captain. See he does it himself.

Space. Also flying through it , the Guardians of the Galaxy. After receiving a distress call they jump right into the middle of wreckage and dead bodies. And as such they catch a Thor sized bug splat on their windshield. It is even dramatic enough to get grout to look up from his game. After examining their new guest and determining that one more meatball sub will turn Quill as round as such , Mantis awakens Thor. Who asks the only relevant question. Who the hell are these people? Thor accepts the free food and listens as Gammora rehashes Wong's points on the infinity stones , her fathers desire to kill half of all life and so forth. Thor bonds with Gammora when he realizes her family sucks as bad as his did. All this over Quills insecurities. After the issue of Quill's voice and the crews food is settled , it is determined Thanos is bound for knowhere to fetch another stone.

Left undetermined? Whether or not Kevin Bacon is a member of the Avengers. Ultimately, it is decided , Thor , his new rabbit friend and the itree will go fetch him a new weapon.

Quill and the remaining morons will go to knowhere.

In a cold Scottish night Wanda and Vision stay warm in a pleasant hotel suite. On a venture out for local Haggis , the news reveals disturbing events that make Visions recent complaints about his infinity stone seem more than passing events. Little time is give for deciding the next move as Thanos warriors attack with the upper hand. Their plans are derailed when the Captain and company intervene on the subway. They are scolded on not checking in and the jet heads back to HQ.

Gammora is well aware that in Thanos hands she is a weapon against Quill and the mission. She asks Quill if she is captured to kill her. Which he does not want to agree too but does. They arrive in knowhere and head straight to the collector. Sadly , the master plan falls to pieces and Thanos has already captured the infinity stone. Quill unable to kill Gammora watch as Thanos abducts her.

Back at Avengers HQ , the renegades arrive to a not so friendly government welcome. Rhodie slides that conversation to the left and moves deftly to the awkward reunion of Banner and Black Widow. The room shifts to a yet more important conversation the theory put forth by Vision on how to destroy his infinity stone. Wanda is having none of it. Being the only one who can , this is problematic. The solution ? Wakanda . Where the stone may be able to be removed without killing Vision. Back in said place The King prepares for battle and invites the one armed bandit to join the fight.

Back in the ring of power Stark is still working on the liberation of all things Strange. Quite the Caper he finds Strange and retrieves a missing garment. Then the best news. Parker is back and in need of serious parenting. None of which is going to occur in a spaceship. The good news? The kid has seen old movies and now he wants to talk about Aliens. Ironman shows down the baddie torturing Strange for his infinity stone and blow a hole in his ship sending him a lethal chill message while spider reels Strange in.

It's agreed Thanos will be fought away from earth. Strange must protect the stone even in the face of Stark and Parker's death. Parker is now an Avenger fully Offical.

On Thanos chariot , father and Daughter are engaged in a long conversation about life and it's choices. As an example Thanos offers Gammora the chance to save Nebula from death. The price. The name of the world that keeps an infinity stone. Vormir. Upon their arrival Thanos and Gammora are greeted by a familiar face from many movies ago.

The stone is not free , it has a high price. You must kill that which you love. Thanos throws Gammora under the bus , and claims the stone.

Thor and Rocket have arrived at the legendary forge of Nidavellir , only to find it shut down and out of stock. The forgemaster it seems was tricked into making a gauntlet for Thanos to contain his stones. After which Thanos killed everyone and maimed him. Thor will not be daunted in his task , he single handed ly reignites the legendary forge and the master makes him an axe head. With no handle. Groot sighs and for a switch sets his hand held game down , tendering the needed handle him self.

Strange , Stark and Parker land on titan. Thanks to a message from nebula the other morons from knowhere are there to greet them. After awhile they realize they are on the same team. All agree when it comes to Thanos they should Kick Names and Take Ass. Strange in the mean time in engaged in a deep bromance with his infinity stone and has discovered only one way to win. Everyone agrees it is the plan.

Vision has arrived in a still Starbucks free Wakanda. Banner bows before the king for Rhodes personal enjoyment. The super genius in the Kings lair teams with Banner to remove the stone but will need time. Right on cue the bad guys arrive. When the super bomb fails to destroy the shield dome , they land a kennel of rabid space dogs. The Black Panther however is no pussy. He and his army open several pallets of kick arse all over the mobile zoo. Just as the fight seems hopeless and all are being over run arrives Thor with his new axe ready to put the spark back in the teams fight.

Thanos has arrived on Titan on the other side of the Galaxy. Strange and Thanos reminisce about Titan past while our heroes set up the trap. From falling moons to millions of things strange the team attempts everything under Titans sun to extract the gauntlet. In the end it proves futile and Strange surrenders his stone to Thanos. Back in Wakanda the situation with Vision grows worse and Thanos little brats are closing in. Sensing this Vision leaves the operation and heads to the nearby woods. Having beaten the team on Titan , Thanos returns to earth to retrieve the final stone. Try as they will the Avengers do not go for the head. Thanos manipulates time and retrieves the final stone from Vision. With a full set of stone he snaps his fingers and achieves his goal. Those that live watch as half of all before them turn to dust.

They fight , they fight , they fight , they fight , they fight , the itchy and scra....er Avengers: Infinity War....

Avengers: Infinity War,"A film filled with dull, naive and whiny ""super"" heroes.",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"This review is in response to clearly faked bots posting fake 10 star reviews Ahaha, this film is nonsense of the highest order. Hulk is too scared to fight? Or they can't bothered writing about him? They'll keep making this crap if you disagree with me. Fandom disease spreads like wildfire",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"What imbecile was responsible for that final battle scene? Permeated with tactical errors, the final battle in the fictional world of Wakanda has got to be the most teeth-gnashingly horrible battle put to screen. Honestly, this makes Return of the King's Osgiliath battle look like genius. Let's look into the what mistakes they made.

The location: The battle takes place in a fictional country protected by a force-field shield (think Gungun army from Star Wars), inside the circular shield is a city in the middle with grassy plains around it, but still inside the shield. The battle started with the enemy troops landing outside the shield and being forced to walk through onto the grassy field. Apparently the Avengers decided to meet them there, on a flat, wide plain where the numerical advantage of the enemy would work most to the hero's disadvantage leading them to be easily encircled and slaughtered. The Avengers do not take advantage of the city's walls and mounted cannons we can clearly see behind them, nor do they use any aerial fighters excluding the ones among them who can fly; no planes or helicopters are used, nor is there a reason given as to why not.

The weapons: I have already stated the moronic absence of aerial superiority, but that is not the end of it. Despite being an advanced culture facing a haphazard mob of monsters armed with nothing but fists and teeth, the Avenger's army is outfitted for the most part with spears, swords, and shields. There IS one smart guy in the group, Bucky Barnes, who systematically machine-guns down the enemy without letting them get near him. That was the smart thing to do, but the rest of the heroes charge the mob head on, allowing the enemy to take the most advantage of their weapons (fists and teeth).

The organization: The Avengers don't have any battle plan or trap of any kind; the plan as far as I can figure is ""Go get them!"". There is no formation of any kind, besides a homogenous mass of soldiers charging en masse into the arms of the enemy. Why this is, we don't know.

The scale: One thing that catches attention of this battle is that the Avengers treat it as the battle for the dominion of the earth. Indeed, if the enemy were to win, half of the universe's beings would be wiped out of existence. But if this battle was indeed so important, why wasn't any nations army there? Granted the US government would be skeptical sending troops over to an African country to help spandex sporting soldiers, but as seen in Captain America Civil War the Government DOES take the Avengers seriously and would likely do even more after a giant spaceship appears above Manhattan previously in this film. I digress. Having only a platoon of Marines could dramatically alter the battle, what with machine guns and explosive grenades. Heck, the enemy army could be wiped out without even reaching the city walls using a couple Apache helicopters armed with miniguns and rockets. Once again, these enemies are armed with only fists and teeth; any ranged weapons such as guns would completely wipe out any charge without a casualty. (There's a reason WWI ended mass charges, it was a bloodbath whenever someone tried). Somehow drug cartels can get mounted machine guns, but ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" can't? Just imagine what modern tanks and a squad of heavy-machine gunners could do to Thanos's pathetic army.

The decisions: The orders given during the course of battle by the Avengers are also failures. When the monsters begin to force their way into the shield and encircle the Avengers. In response to this, the Avengers order to open a portion of the shield to center the enemy's forces so they can kill them better. Now a more successful tactic would be to maintain the shield and retreat to the city, killing any of the enemy that make it to the walls, as only a couple enemies get through the shield and it can be seen that walking through the shield burns and amputates the monsters. However, if one does want to open the shield, it would be better to open and closing it systematically, using a military tactic known as ""Defeat in Detail"". This tactic allows smaller armies to defeat much larger armies. In this case, the shield would open, letting a small portion of the enemy army into the inner circle, and then close it, trapping a small army against the Avenger's much larger one, allowing the Avengers to slaughter the enemy with near no casualties. This could be repeated as many times as long as there is still an enemy army standing.

Oh yeah, and don't even bring up the extremely powerful superpowers that some of the heroes use once and never again.

And Tony Starks Nanotech is the stupidest thing I have seen in one of these movies by far, and they don't even try to hide it's CGI.",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"What a boring, pointless and terrible movie.

Marginally more entertaining than Civil War, better than Memento (because the constant scene flipping was at least in some sort of order), but less entertaining than watching paint dry.

I can't write a subjective review because I feel saddened that I spent money to watch this. Perhaps I should have read some of the comic books first? I just can't stop seeing this as just yet another money maker for all concerned. For me, it was a stupid, erratic, often lost, story line that made little to no sense and stands only on the merits of the talented CGI artists.

Bored, boring, boredom. Yawn, ""has it finished yet?""..

Synopsis: I would have been happier to have just written Marvel a check, then at least I wouldn't have the experience of: ""what a pile of ......""",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"I don't understand how this movie got so much hype, it's completely ridiculous. The time Thanos took to gather all the infinity stones (six years) he could've went to the planets and killed half of the people. He didn't even complete his mission which was to and I quote ""destroy half of ALL lif in the universe"" which was later change to creatures because they noticed he didn't do that. Their were a bunch of unnecessary scenes and scenes that didn't even make sense. This movie was all over the place and was very hard to follow. Spoiler right here---> A example of this was when he through Gamora off the cliff he shed one tear and was like whatever I now have the last soul stone, and Gamora was the only person Thanos loved and he didn't seem like he cared. The other complete ridiculous thing about this movie is the spiderman bus scene in Homecoming it didn't show he had spidey sense, and finally it was aid in the movie the stones were scatter across the universe that should've taken Thanos longer to find them. My final review 2/10 would not recommend this movie to any superhero fan. The whole movie was just a way for marvel to get money. If you want to see this method done right go to Justice League or Legends of Tomorrow.",2

Avengers: Infinity War,"To all you fans of the film, and others I may offend, please understand, this review is not about taking down your childhood/memorable ties to the superheroes, it's really just an honest review. That said, I too am a fan of comics and superheroes (Marvel/DC included. I walked into the theater with no knowledge of spoilers and the internet hype, no expectations, (yes, if you turn off your internet you will notice how many people don't care about how great the movie was) and I walked out a few minutes ago feeling the same as I did for the last marvel movie and the one before that and so on.

To anyone who watches movies (acclaimed ones, not the popular merchandise selling, trilogy/series expanding films out there), it is easy to notice the studio laying ground work in the film for resurrecting all the heroes it just killed, because lets face it, no one is giving up the rights to spider-man or 'nick-fury' till the fad of superheroes is taken over by the next generation of media (or till Samuel Jackson hits 76 and they make a 'Logan' film for him). It was kind of a popular yet shameful move they used where they split the film in two (a 3 hr movie would never sell as much as 2 highly awaited 2 hour films with filler'awkward' jokes and pip culture references).

A corny 'I love my daughter Gamora so much that I have to kill her' scene to add a little back story to the otherwise bland antagonist, and many such ridiculous gimmicks forced into the film to facilitate all the superheros did not make the experience any better. CGI was good, but nothing better than an average 3-D film nowadays. Music was by Skywalker sounds. and is easily relate-able to 15+ Lucas films movies (and Rubber-band Man because recycling old catchy music we all subconsciously listened to as kids is something the guardians producers like to do. Maybe it would bring out nostalgia if you are older than 22).

honestly. this film doesn't deserve the rating fans are giving it and no doubt, it will die out in a while, so I suggest those of you who are planning on watching it, go now so you can judge for yourself before your neighbor decides how great the film is for you or before the hype dies out and nobody cares. Oh yeah, most importantly, human superheros can now breathe in space without any gear because the millions of dollars they spend on paying the actors goes to waste if under a space suit.

If you have made up your mind to wait anxiously for the next few films and don't like this review, don't waste your energy hating people like me, go do something productive. If you haven't yet watched the film, go watch it with a fan. You'll be entertained, no doubt.",2
Avengers: Infinity War,"After telling people that I didn't really like this movie and, of course, getting attacked by every fanboy in the MCU I felt it necessary to put down a proper review.

Let me start with the good so you know that I did not hate this movie. I actually enjoyed it. Infinity War is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The entertainment value comes to fighting is great, a couple of superhero saves that are utterly amazing, acting very solid, music great, visuals mostly fantastic, and the villain is mostly great too. If you look at infinity war as a prelude to the end of the first big story-line of the MCU and if you look at it from a pure entertainment point of view this is by no means a bad movie, it is, from that perspective, darn good.

Above sound like I loved this movie, right? So why didn't I?

Because this movie has a few very, very big flaws, and it introduces a few concept and a bunch of additional McGuffins in a very hamfisted way and I do not think it completely nailed the landing.

Let me elaborate.

Let's start with Iron Man. So Tony, suddenly, and completely out of the blue, introduces his new Nano-tech suit. Where did that come from? When was that developed? Why never mention before? This tech is so immensely impressive that Iron Man go from being a strong hero to almost invincible. If it wasn't for fighting Thanos with the Gauntlet, Iron Man would win almost any fight against almost any opponent now. Sure it looks pretty cool and the Russo brothers make the best of it in the movie, but... what!? It actually pissed me off. Marvel has been very good at building up these things over time, over full movies, but here the nano-tech is just thrown in there because it looks cool. That is the only reason it is there, to make the visuals and the fight look cooler.

Next up we have Vision and Scarlet Witch that, apparently, and also very suddenly, a couple and are sharing a bed together in some hotel room in Scotland. Now this was not completely out of the blue since it was sort of hinted at in both Civil War and Ultron, but them apparently sleeping together and being a couple in love!? What? I know they were/are a couple in the comics and if I remember correctly even have children together, so perhaps I should not be too surprised and upset over this development, but it makes no sense and it feels so rushed. In the context of the movie universe this is lazy writing, bad character development, and very forced upon us as viewers. Of course Captain America does a great save in a very nice entertaining way so I sort of forgot about this story hole upon first viewing, but it is not good writing. Not at all.

Then we have Thor who, apparently, IS the God of Hammers. AND he gets an eye 25min into the movie, so that entire Ragnarök story in regards to Thor's character development is thrown out the window. Sidetrack: I actually hate Ragnarök, I think it is, by far, the worst movie of the MCU. I think it is worse than Howard the Duck, worse than that awful Daredevil movie and worse then Elektra. Ragnarök is the only MCU movie in par with (some) DCEU movies, that is how putrefied it is. However the only redeeming trait of Ragnarök was the decent okayish character development of Thor that sort of work. But a few moments into Infinity War all of that is basically gone. He has an eye, and suddenly, after withstanding the blast of a star (haha..) he also have a new shiny ax. Then he summons the bifrost and with no knowledge about anything going on nor knowing where Wakanda is he poffs in there to save the day. That scene is absolutely fantastic, one of the best hero arrival ever and it is brilliantly entertaining, but it make no sense whatsoever. Again lazy writing or bad directing.

I could go on pointing out so many other things like Red Skull showing up with no explanation, Gamora suddenly having half her planet alive (it was said before she was the last of her kind), StarLord flipping out (sort of understandable, but still...) and many other things in the movie that either demands background story or more explanation - stories and explanations we never get.

What it all comes down to is either lazy writing or bad directing, probably a combo. The Russo´s have made very good movies before this. Civil War was very entertaining (and better than this movie) and Winter Soldier is as close to a masterpiece a superhero movie can get, but here they fail on several points. If it was just one character or one of the things I mention above (there are many more of these holes are missing pieces in the movie - take too long to list them all) it could be forgiven, but there are so many of them. I keep getting the feeling that they wanted to make a super-entertaining movie and a part One out of Two to end this saga, and they did so with little consideration for good writing. Why not an exposition dump? A narration or two? Why not ignore one of the fights and slow down and explain things? No! We need entertainment! Boff! Poff! Blam! Isn't this fun!?

Now I come to my final, and most significant objection to this movie, and also most likely the most unpopular opinion of this review. The villain, Thanos, I wrote above that; ""the villain is mostly great too"", but he is also completely weird and a really bad villain. Kill half the universe? Why? Never explained other than in his; ""I am a green party member and I want to kill folk because we use too many resources"" which is stupid beyond belief. How about double the number of planets? How about giving everyone a Star Trek replicator? How about clean energy? I hope his motivation is explained in Endgame, but if not he is just nuts, bonkers, crazy. In the comics his motivation was much, much more relevant and understandable, and that was crazy. And people complain that Captain Marvel is political? Really? This is the environment movement´s wet dream, nothing else.

To summerize; this should be called McGuffin War because they fight over McGuffins with their own McGuffins and we get introduced to new McGuffins, out of nowhere, to counteract other McGuffins. And when Thanos finally collect all of his McGuffins he kills half the universe because we drive too many cars... It is lazy writing, and bad storytelling. Sure it looks great, and all those explosions are nice, and oh boy all those McGuffins are fun and entertaining, but does that make a great movie? Is this really fantastic?

No.

To me this movie belongs in the mid- to low range of the MCU. There is a reason why Iron Man, Winter Soldier, and now also Captain Marvel, are the best movies of this franchise; because they are character driven stories. Sure those also have faults, and are perhaps not as entertaining as McGuffin War, but they are better movies because we get exposition, explanations, and we get to follow the characters in a logical well executed way. McGuffin war is just 2hrs and 30min of high-speed entertainment. It is almost like a Transformers movie, only better acted.

And that is why I give this movie a 6/10.

If Endgame do not explain some of the things I mention above I am most likely not going to like that movie either. BUT if it does, this movie probably need to be seen in a different light and I might need to up the score, but as of now it does not deserve a higher score.

Edit: Since Endgame was horrible trash and explained absolutely nothing of McGuffin War it made also this movie worse. Endgame sucked so hard it was almost Justice League bad, and although McGuffin War was not as bad I have to reduce the score to 3/10. The Russo brothers should be banned from cinema for all time.",2

Avengers: Infinity War,"Marvels superhero movies are getting sillier and sillier, and this is by far the silliest of them all so far. Embarrasing really and rock solid proof some of todays movies and entertainment media (including tv shows) are dumbing so-called humans down... alot. Because you really have to be dumb as a coconut to enjoy this smack-everyone-in-the-face fest with over-the-top powerful superheroes trying to save half of all life in the universe, which btw they fail miserably with. This failing goes on throughout the entire movie and constitutes its single redeeming quality. I am a bit bummed out that all life in the omniverse wasn't ended by Thanos because that would actually been great news when it would have raised mankinds average IQ by 15 points during the next upcoming 5 years because of the total lack of upcoming new Marvel movies.",2

The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes.

In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.

Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening.

Avengers: Infinity War,Lame movie. It has cut scenes from one section to another. No cohesion. It's like a best of program from one bit to the next. The ending was nonexistent. If Thanos has every stone he would be GOD in all caps. Nothing could stop him and nothing should have. Did anything actually stop him? The ending was so vague. Just an appalling movie that cashed in on the Marvel franchise. Are any of these movies actually that good? They're like products that people buy because they're put out there. There's not much substance to any of them. They're a good watch at the time but nothing destined to be classic cinema.

Maybe you enjoyed Watchmen and figure this will be in the same vein. You might have really enjoyed Shutter Island and Revenant. If you haven't watched MCU before, and worry you may find Infinity Wars a predictable series of shallow plot cliches, unengaging lead characters you just can't care about, and too-obvious tropes - you're probably right. You'll need to be totally invested in the Marvel universe to watch this film. As for something unexpected - there's one short dreamlike red segment at 2h10m that has artistic credibility. The rest is CGI by the numbers.

Even the music is annoyingly cliched. I don't notice the music in a good film when it works, but it just felt like a computer wrote this score.

Was this actually a movie, or advertisement for its sequel (sssss)? At least there were all sorts of stars in this thing. You know, ummmm, everybody and their brother and their sister and then some. Yeah. Everybody! Wowee! Makes the head spin 'Exorcist' style, yeehaw. So what were Ironman, those others and (my favorite) snotty, teenager Groot doing? I don't know. Fighting evil way out in outer space, kind of like Superman and Batman. Why didn't they run into them while they were out there? 'Infinity Wars' seemed like tremendous potential was wasted. For one thing, way too many superheroes. I lost interest in what they were all doing with the exception of Groot and the rest of Guardians of the Galaxy. This thing was probably 15 minutes too long. And I know I shouldn't say this, but I'm not wasting my time or money on the sequel. I like many of the early Marvel projects, but now they have gotten way too big. Meh, time to move on.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"Thanos is busy collecting Infinity Stones for his Gauntlet, starting out by killing Loki, and spends the bulk of the movie roving around the universe collecting most of them, while his minions try to get the two on this planet, thwarted by the various super-powered individuals (and the Black Widow), while the Guardians of the Galaxy hook up with Thor to thwart him from one and build the anti-Thanos weapon, preparatory to the final battle which (spoiler) takes place in Wakanda.

The three hour movie rambled hither and yon, with most characters getting enough screen time to be identifiable. Nonetheless, at the forty-five-minute mark, I whispered to my cousin ""I've lost track of who's who"" and he muttered back ""Me too"", despite having seen all the earlier movies. Chris Hemsworth as Thor gets the best jokes, there's one major continuity issue that annoyed me in the big final battle, and the visuals abandoned their adherence to comics I could identify -- understandably so, given the great range of sources they used. Still, it was a well-run matter, even if the MCU has gotten too large for a single movie to include everyone.

For those who look forward to the little scene that runs after the credit starts, you'll have time to duck out for a quick bathroom break (almost three hours, as I said), as it takes place at the end of the credits and leads into CAPTAIN MARVEL, schedule for 2019 -- which is supposed to be set in the 1990s.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"What a snooze-fest. Thankfully Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsowrth lifted the mood with their occasional humour but the weakest offering from the franchise by far and it was already a low bar. A bad guy that looks like he's suffering 'roid-rage', a protracted assembly of the various marvel characters and a finale that leaves me wanting less Spoiler-alert, this is tosh",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"Yeah, I'm coming to this flick late.

This movie looks cheap. And the ""actors'"" who spent their careers wanting to do something serious? You can tell they strain to get the corny stupid lines out of their mouths. I'm sure a few of them will look back on this and cringe, because most of it is cringe. Save for Josh Brolin who does a remarkable job vomiting horrible dialogue convincingly.

What is the point of this tale? Does anyone know.

The bad guy wants some jewels to control the universe. And? Is this suppose to be Alexander the Great. Sacrifice your loved ones for power? Probably not best told through this cartoon.

The green screen world building looks cheap. How is that even possible with the amount of money spent. Facial expression look weird. And they really attempt to cram every Avenger character in this mess before they can fleece you for the next installment.

This is not a movie. This is a trailer for the next movie. And, of course, fangirls will absorb it as this is all they are offered. Horrid.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"If there was any more CGI, they might as well have made a cartoon.

The dialog and delivery was just cheesy.

Given the massive variety of powers, strengths and vulnerabilities of the characters, there should have been plenty of the more human based ones that were crushed or crippled if they were subjected to the brutal fights.

I get that it's a comic book film, and disbelief needs suspending, but this was just utter cr@p",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"Having seen this movie, I am at a loss for words. Starting with: Thanos beating the hulk. So no more the madder hulk gets ect.? Thanos grunting to lift the hulk over his head. I guess Hulkie has put on a few pounds between movies. the horrible use of the vision in this movie. EVERYBODY can kick his butt. He played the almost helpless heroine role in this flick. One of the most powerful avengers bitched slapped by every child of Thanos in the room. Even without the mind of reed Richards in the mix.There is enough 'big' brains in the ensemble of avengers to work out a better plan then 'Just wait for Thanos to arrive'. And the fact NO use of the technology from any of the other movies is even mentioned ..well the Black Panther had the same suit...but maybe it was laundry day, so he had to ware his old stuff. When did the Asgardian GODS become such wimps? These people are a WARRIOR people. The live for war. Well these people sure retreat like no other. Oh and where is the Odin force? Not with this thunder god obviously Why couldn't Doctor Strange use the time stone? I guess all those portals he and Wong were throwing around like there was no tomorrow were just for show. You know they cant be used for offensive purposes . Just ask Cull about this.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,There is nothing about this film for anyone above the age of 12.,3
Avengers: Infinity War,"Just my opinion take that as you will, or just tell how wrong i am in the comments.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"Sorry, but it was. To me it seemed some evil villain surgically removed most of the characters' humour (they try, sometimes it works, but often it comes out just strained) and replaced it with pompousness and ostentatious sentimentality. The story is pushed onwards with obvious effort, scenes pile up with an obvious primary intention to impress and move, gone is the joy, fun and ease of the first Avengers. It looked a little like Marvel was trying to give birth to a DC movie and the labour was hard indeed.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"Seriously! There are so many plot fails. For example when Thanos is battling Iron Man why not just turn all his missiles into bubbles like you did with Quill's gun?

Everyone wants to save everyone and in the end they lose most of them. Awesome! They got exactly what they deserved.

They say they want to stop trillions from dying but then make stupid decisions.

Loki what the heck. Let's just hand over the tesseract. You barely care for anyone anyway, so why get mushy now.

Gamora should have committed suicide before her sister was tortured. She wanted to die anyway.

Gamora should have let her sister die rather than just handing over the location.

They almost get the glove off and Quill goes all stupid and punches Thanos. Yes, the world is about to end so let's do stupid stuff. Thank heavens he dies.

Dr. Strange should have let Iron Man die but would rather let millions die. Good choice. And then he dies.

Vision wanted to die but no one would destroy the stone. He dies anyway. Twice actually.

It's brilliant. All these smart people doing stupid stuff. You can't even explain their behavior by pulling the ""morally right"" card because there are only a couple heroes that fit that bill.

Watch the movie for the special effects because there isn't much plot to speak of.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"I have to admit I wasn't a fan of superhero movies . Besides ''Iron Man 1'', ''Thor 1 '' and ''Guardians of the Galaxy 1 '' I haven't seen any other movie from Marvel . But this movie completely changed my perspective . As soon as I saw it , I had to look for the rest of the movies to understand the plot . And I haven't felt sorry . It's their best movie so far . For two hours and a half you'll see continuous action with breathtaking CGIs . No wonder they gained more than 2 billions worldwide . I have one messages for the morons giving one or two stars : go and see the other movies to understand this one , mthfks !!! Don't write a bad review just because you don't understand it .",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"Brief parts were interesting and exciting but frankly most of it was predictable and cringe-worthy. It was better then Infinity War but that was terrible so nothing to be proud of. Only one real good part and that was about 10 seconds long in a 3 hour movie, goes on for too long at the end with nothing happening",3
Avengers: Infinity War,It's unbelievable just how many different films and characters this movie can cram in. Some funny moments but ended up turning the movie off before it ended. The Avengers started off well but this film is just too much and far too many crossovers. It's ruined the franchise for me,3
Avengers: Infinity War,Just not worth it. Skip I if you can. Plus 2 1/2 hours.,3
Avengers: Infinity War,"Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel's latest blockbuster, actually got more right than I expected. The opening scene started with a good amount of tension, people died right away, and you begin to think this might be their best one yet.

Then.

The first half an hour ends and the film becomes utterly consumed by a horde of swarming side plots and then completely falls apart in one of the most excruciating drops from decently engaging to excruciating I can think of. With each added character, the emotional stakes lessen and lessen until all you have left is a mental checklist of who you think is going to die. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem but for two things: the Russo bro's utter incompetence in crafting well-made action scenes, and the laughable ridiculousness of the script's attempts to be philosophical. First off, the action scenes. They retain some trippy visuals and entertain on the basic level, but for the most part are reduced to illogical CGI barf where characters are flung around and punched like rag dolls. Yes, the superheroes get beaten in the end, but you never doubt for a second that they will be able to fix it; the climax would have had more emotional heft if Iron Man wasn't always transforming like a liquid Terminator and if Spider Man could quit sprouting more arms and superpowers. All these little pop-up tricks really undermine whatever stakes there are supposed to be in this movie. It's a problem I have with superhero movies in general, that we're watching powerful people beating other powerful people, and succeeding because they have more powers, etc. It just doesn't make a good story. The action culminates, meanwhile, in a massive, shaky-cam, lamely choreographed battle which was probably meant to evoke the Lord of the Rings but I kept getting flashbacks to the Phantom Menace. (Bubble shield to cover the good guys, check. Miniature bubble shields for good guy troops, check. Giant bad guy troop carriers, check. Hordes of cannon-fodder troops, check. What visionaries the Russos are). Once again, the Avengers' strategy is to charge their enemies-forget it, that doesn't even work as a strategy. The battle then revs up and we are treated to so many acts of maximum destruction that all impact is lost. It's like watching a house of cards being atomic bombed. Then, due to a series of tactical blunders, they lose anyway. Just one way for them to win, Doctor Strange says? You might want to check another couple million possibilities because you probably overlooked something.

Okay, on to the script. It attempts to philosophize with its pretty lame villain, Thanos, who is only considered great because he has been teased for so long he must be good, right? He isn't. The movie doesn't even offer any reason why he's wrong other than ""You just can't kill people!"". Well, he's saving the environment, I'm sure Michael Moore would encourage him. The whole thing is just ridiculous. Besides, if he's so concerned about the universe's 'finite resources', why doesn't he just use the all-powerful Infinity McGuffins to create more resources instead of killing a bunch of people? Can he not do this even when he has a 'reality stone' that controls reality or something like that? It's total nonsense. The writers are good at making you laugh, but when it comes to anything serious or thought provoking they're doomed.

Well, at least we still have the characters, and seeing them lose was pretty refreshing after their string of 20 some victories. But then you get on to Endgame, and this movie looks like an artistic masterpiece...",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"This film features almost all the marvel's superheroes and it isnt personally entertaining to see all of them at oke place just for few moments. The most lifting factor in the whole movie is the character thanos and the background score here and there. This film is not so fun and entertaining when it is compared with many other marvel movies like black panther , spiderman,etc",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"I could not be more dissapointed with the plot, the endless supply of ""super heroes"", and the constant explanations about other MCU movies you might not have seen. Spoiler...Thanks wants to eliminate half of the universe's population all because his planet was overcrowded. Ah, boo hoo! Such banal drivel. So why did Rocket and Groot die? They were animals and plants... Really boring jokes at inappropriate times didn't help either. The only good thing to come out of this fatuous ending is that we won't have to be worrying about future MCU movies with the ones that died. #NuffSaid",4
Avengers: Infinity War,Honestly DC Movies are more interesting this is a hot piece of garbage yes there are some good scenes but like bro why are people crying lol it's so obvious there alive lol and the deaths are so badly dramatic the ending is pretty trash if you see people on this review list saying DC Fanboys are making bad reviews actually were not because were just stating facts Marvel doesn't suck but it's not better than DC.,4
Avengers: Infinity War,"I have never seen something like this. So, I was really impressed when I was watching it. I love Marvel and his characters. Let's imagine that it happens in our world. I live in this story and impressive play.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Watching this movie was making me ask why there are so many unemployed actors in L. A., and the well-paid spend their time ""acting"" in the likes of this one. I guess the kids need time off from their smartphones.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"This movie was so long. Endless fighting, endless wars in so many different places, all just to be unresolved at the end? You are kidding? I would have felt like I wasted money walking out of the theaters.

It had great fx and all, and I do like thanos. It was nice to see guardians of the galaxy. Disappointed in hulk dysfunction. Tony stark more full of himself than ever. Gosh. Did not like.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Great CGI and visually good scenes, however i think the plot and script was bad and the charecters are the same old pain in the as* enoying ect. ect.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Acting was great but overall, a huge disappointment!! This movie might as well been a freaking soap opera. I had high expectations but feel like I wasted time watching this. Usually superhero flicks are action packed, but this....not so much.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"If i sit the keyboard, i could create a better scenario for sure bruh.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"This movie is a bit longer than 2 hours, it took me about 4 hours to finish it.

Why? Because I paused frequently. To check this, to do that. Basically, I was bored.

It was too jumbled, too many heroes in the same room. First half in: way too many jokes. I swear I was expecting someone to fart at some point.

all the others looked pretty worn out and tired as I felt at the end of this movie.

Not many sparks. Mostly CGI and fan fiction. And dramatic music, pretty much non-stop.

No soul. No soul is the death of love.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,I was not amazed by this movie! Black Panther is way more culturally relevant.,4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Terrible Dialogue, Plot holes everywhere, Amazing Cgi. I was entertained but its a crappy film the only reason i wanted to watch it is because it would probably have amazing cgi and it did.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,I didn't like this one that even though i'm a fan of the avenger movies.,4
Avengers: Infinity War,Just getting silly. Not really interested anymore. Lost interest after 20 minutes.. Bye bye... Silly verse..,4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Two and a half hours and what do you get? Nothing!

This film is merely an exercise in CGI, lots of fighting, no actual story and finally turns to dust. I shake my head in shame and can't believe what I saw. Perhaps I was half asleep of boredom and can't relate the story.

It was definitely a spectacle, but honestly, just a spectacle of nothingness. I must stop wasting my time and don't bother about the follow-up to come. Marvel is no longer marvelous.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"If I had to choose a movie where I don't connect AT ALL with something almost unanimous for the audience and public, it would have to be this one.

There was no shortage of opportunities. This is the 3rd time I've watched it - because I want to see Guardians 3 with all the chronology on my head - and...I fell asleep all 3 times, always in the 2nd act. People always think that this is one of the MCU movies that I should really like when in fact I prefer to watch movies like Captain Marvel, fully aware of what they are.

The truth is that narratively, this is a huge mess. The first two acts are bad. In the first two-thirds of the movie, it jumps from place to place without any coherence, without any development, with ugly and dark settings, and without being able to involve me at all. One of the characters that I love the most in the MCU died and I felt nothing. A character that had made me feel a lot in two Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Another essential character of the MCU - the main? - that everyone loves died and...I felt nothing again. As for the others who died, I never cared about them, so whatever.

But I think that's really one of the reasons why this movie is so beloved. Because there are several surprising deaths because it was seen in theatres by large audiences (and probably kids/teens cried a lot), because it has several ""wow moments"" (even if they are poorly developed), and because it's a story that many people invested a lot of their time in. As a movie, it's not good. No. The childish humour is always present in the first two hours in a ridiculous way for what is happening on screen and without any funny jokes - except for the scene where Quill meets Thor - and it made me roll my eyes 30 times. Every time. It made me completely withdraw emotionally from the movie.

But well, it's dark, it's full of action (almost only action, to be fair), it has surprising deaths, and a dramatic ending. I'm absolutely sure that's why it's loved. Nothing to do with its qualities as good cinema.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Whatever the story lacks, Computer CGI compensates.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"I was wondering who a sequel like this reaches a IMDB score of 8,6. Starting the film I had great expectations! But I really found NOTHING in this movie that is worth more than 4 stars. This is a senseless digital action trash with no story at all! It´s just a bunch of knows characters fighting the almighty bad guy ... No new Ideas, not funny, not emotional, just explosions and fist fights with some magic artefact lacking any sense. And the end of it is just -to be continued-. Even that tiny bit of story is not even told to the end. Its a shame that this move stands among great films with a rating of over 8. If you watch it please rate it properly and send it down to where it belongs!",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Rank system i use is it can only be ONE movie that is the best and then get 10, to get a 9 it have to be something extraordinarily like Alien and so, a 5 is a ok movie nothing more nothing less its simple a mainstream movie.

As i wrote in the topic it was just to much to many super heros and mix off them simple felt to much and the Movie was like 1hour to long.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"This is the full live-action film debut of Thanos(voice-acted by Josh Brolin of No Country For Old Men fame). The film's plot seems heavily inspired from the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. Namely: The Lord Of The Rings.

Plot: Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment..

This movie like all the other movies before it relies heavily on modern C.G.I. graphics. These days Hollywood movies use C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) like a crippled man uses his crutches. And also beefed up sound-effects...

All the actors play their roles as programmed R.P.G. characters play out in a video game. There is a lack of casting and acting talent these days in Hollywood. Indeed this era is the most uninspiring compared to the legendary 80's era, where some of the greatest movie to ever grace the silver screen were made.

Verdict: I would recommend this film as a time-pass sort of movie where you have nothing to do but kill time(figuratively speaking).",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Very predictable. Main heroes get no time to shine. Subplots are cliche. Despite some very good actors and, at times acting, all depth to the acting was stolen by the writing. Perhaps that was why the music was do prominent. So that despite my boredom I would know what to feel.

I like super heroes, I can appreciate quality acting and action scenes. But this unimaginative writing is symptomatic for why so few Hollywood films are exciting.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"First about the herd of low star ratings decrying the cost. Learn patience and wait until a library has a copy. Second, the movie & music industries long ago established non-competitive pricing amongst themselves for their products that garnered excessive profits (like the pharmaceutical peoples today). Apple & digital helped to reduce that. The message at the beginning ""Piracy is not a victimless crime ... harms the economy."" is in place w/the help of lobbyists and politicians (wanting donations), and is mostly meant to maximize those profits. Third, as to the movie it should be commended for it's vast CGI effects although it's getting computer cheap to produce those effects these days. On the down side, out CGI-ing everyone else has the effect of making us boringly saturated with over-effects, and loss of meaningful story, intelligent dialogue & good acting. Fourth, don't expect intelligent scripting e.g. sound effects still in space; physically impossible space structures; bad science i.e. the Big Bang created six colored glass crystals??; the usual colored lasers; fire throwing, & force fields from your hands; swords, guns & naugahyde clothing (from cheap plastic if you don't know); aliens w/vocal structures that speak perfect English (at least they didn't script some subtitled alien speak). Fifth, excessive dramatic music to sub for realistic and/or repetitive action. Dialogue amongst all seemed at a dumbed down level like neighbors arguing over which football team is better. Science dialogue such as describing a ""quadrant"" is pre-digital 19th century accuracy - dumb! Sixth, the ending and the recently overused CGI of bodies turning to ashy bits of floating organic material was obscure, and meant to make more money on a sequel.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"I would want those movies to be good. And seeing a 8,0 and higher usually means your in for a great, Christopher Nolan Niveau movie. That isn't true for Marvel movies though.

Same old same old, CGI feast, no excitement because, let's be honest, we all know how those movies end. Invincible heroes, it's like watching two of these plastic figures in front of car-sellers bowing and getting up in front of each other. This one has a little twist at least but even that felt like it was necessary since a loooong while, so at least for me it didn't even feel exciting, rather like ""pff, I don't care"". But well, I am comparing Marvel movies to actually thought through movies. My own mistake, I admit it.

The ratings for these marvel movies mostly comes from Marvel fans, as they don't have anything groundbreaking, twists, wow-moments or anything else exciting (be aware, that's my opinion, not a ""fact"").

Going into these with my 14 year old sister shows exactly that. She loves all those movies, trying to remember some funny quotes to share with her friends and doesn't care about the repetitive, copy-paste structure of those Marvel stories.

I've watched the first Ironman in the cinema back then, something that was impossible for the main audience nowadays as they weren't even born or needed a diaper change 3 times a day. So I guess I just stop paying for those movies now and rather apply a black and white filter and the likes to the first Ironman if I want to see something ""new"". Thank good there are still innovative movies out there.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"Depressing movie for the mid-thirties who already depressed from work and life and was expecting restriction of the hope in his heart that good still can beat the evil at least in a movie but I found that finally, evil after working hard has beaten good and killed half of the universe. WOW! that is more realistic than life! a big chin Nazi Hitler retired in peace after killing half of the universe. what is better than that for a weekend!",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"The biggest compliment I can give this movie is that there is a genuine sense of threat and an amazing stinger line. However, I consider this a fundamentally broken movie. This is the first movie of the Marvel universe where I genuinely could not engage with the heroes because of how fundamentally awful their decision making was. The film decided instead to grant all of its respect to Thanos, who despite the gravitas of his performance presents a philosophical perspective that is absolutely moronic. Despite this, neither this film or the sequel provide a strong argument against it, leaving it in a place where it feels like a respectable opinion. Look at other reviews and you will see how sympathetic people are to the cult of Thanos. That aside, the decision to have Dr. Strange give an excuse through the mechanism of destiny for the events of the movie to be ""the only way"" (paraphrasing) to defeat Thanos is the kind of ridiculously lazy plotting I expect of any movie with Dr. Strange. Also, the critical failure of character from the Avengers in Infinity War is their unwillingness to compromise their inflexible values in order to achieve something fundamentally more important. This would be okay if the second movie didn't give them a way out of this problem and undo all of the consequences of the mistake. This renders this movie philosophically pointless, if not philosophically harmful. What we are left with is a gripping but ultimately hollow attempt to cash in on audience investment in a franchise to sell a ridiculous spectacle, and convince people that it means something.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I thought the premise was original to an extent. I enjoyed the humour of the Daniel's working together. Great concept, vision and humour. I think I suffered seizures from the constant camera cutting and this time, there were no warnings. A veteran director working with the Daniel's might have helped the final edit of the movie.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,This movie is the reason I believe Marvel movies and shows have been on the decline in recent history. This is not any better. All over the place with the jump cuts. Don't know why the theme of alternate realities is such a common theme these days. To each their own. I personally wish I watched something else with my time.,1

The concept of the movie is really cool and it had potential to be so good! There are just too many weird scenes, and for me it was a bit too much. It distracted from the main story. Parts of the movie are just so strange!!! I feel like if it was a little more serious and the alternate universes were more realistic it would have been really good.

I will say the acting was great and the visual effects were pretty good too. I also enjoyed the overall themes of the movie. I just had to look past all the super weird parts to actually enjoy the movie.

Overall, as creative as the movie is, it did not live up to the hype.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I usually like these kind of movies, it started not bad but then... They try to do a matrix like with some multiverse with it, but in a terrible way.

Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I turned this off with an hour to go. I was bored stiff. It was like watching the matrix on crack, except that the matrix is a good movie. This was all over the place. I am dumbfounded as to the high score. I think it's from people who aren't used to non-english speaking films and just assume a film is good because it has subtitles.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I watched this Jay night because if the 8+ recite it got here on IMDB. If only I'd read down through the reviews and sage the more realistic ones.

I did enjoy watching the film recuse of the style but it all fell apart towards the end. It didn't make much sense and it came to a pretty stupid conclusion.

This isn'tscience fiction. It's science crap. A load of rubbish with poorly explained rules and the rules that were interested didn't seem to really apply anyway.

The movie needed to be shorter. It felt way too long.

The redeeming feature was the decent kung fu but there wasn't enough of that.

Waste of time really. I wouldn't be bothered watching again and will say that if you aren't feels good vibes after 30 minutes, watch sobering wise because it really doesn't improve.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This film was bad. I like Michelle Yeoh, but I can't believe she agreed to do this movie. I won't be able to watch another one of her films now with the same respect. Was there really a need to have a room full of BDSM stuff? Was it necessary to have grown men trying to land on butt plugs? Was it necessary to have a fight involving dildos?

Besides all of this the film is pushing pushing relationship agendas that aren't normal.

The first half an hour isn't too bad and there was quite a lot of original arty filming.

Don't waste your time watching this movie. You could watch paint dry instead!",1

Performances are ok but absolutely questionable as to how they became Oscar worthy.

The photography is strangely dark and distracting.

I watch a lot of foreign subtitled movies but found this distracting constantly going between English being spoken and English subtitles.

Ke Huy Quan comes across as seriously miscast in what became an annoying performance for me.

It was a mess for me. It seems unsure what it wants to be.

Maybe I'll give it another try but not any time soon.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"1/10 is too much for it, cause i cant give 0 to it 😂😂😂 This movie is literally and totally wast of time 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 The more i say is because it must contain at least six hundred characters , this movie is so bad , i cant explain more than this. How should i put bad and worse in six hundred of characters? Its just so bad.

This movie don't deserve action comedy genre. I expected to laugh a little bit at least. How you can give comedy genre to this movie?

All genre you can give to it is so bad comedy and very very bad action.

Ughhhh i wasted 2 hours of my life seeing this very very very bad movie.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"While I know a lot of people really liked this movie, it's one major flaw is that for those who don't understand Mandarin and Cantonese have to read the subtitles. Since the action is all over the place, having to look at subtitles to be able to understand what is being said keeps you from being able to watch the movie to see what is happening. It's a terrible combination.

I found that after watching for about 45 minutes, I was exhausted and completely disinterested in watching any more of it.

They took a high-level topic of a multiverse and made a stupid movie about it. The activities were stupid. Their meeting with the IRS agent was stupid. Virtually everything in the movie was stupid. Not funny, not interesting, just frenetic, stupid, random activities.

I'd give it negative stars if that were a rating.

I'm glad we saw it for free, so I didn't waste anything but 45 minutes of my time on it.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I was so bored... great talent was wasted. I thought perhaps it was just me but then I got onto other media and a lot of people felt the same as I did. ""Nothing, nowhere over a long period of time "" was one review I read and I have to agree. I had really high hopes for this movie as it was buzzed about so much.. really overhyped and I really like the main actress Michelle Yeo but I was so disappointed and it just didn't keep my attention. And so much violence! I also felt that half the dialogue was just gibberish. A lot of scenes just switched from one parallel world to the next and to me it just didn't make sense..",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Is this the favorite for the academy award this year, really??!!! What's special about this movie?!!! There's no plot! The movie is boring, confusing and slow...there's no bottom line! There's nothing but a few action and fighting sequences. It's impossible to tell the movies story because there's really not one. It's just a bunch of people from an Asian family in US that own a laundry and l from there the movie turns in and I'm incomprehensible story and nonsense fiction and confusing dialogues that lead nowhere at all! It's hard to believe that this filme can get that attention it has been getting. It's boring and in a year or two no one will watch it.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"...to write 600 characters on a movie you only watched for 15 seconds. Let's be clear, this is a foreign language movie so subtitles in English are included. I feel cheated. Why isn't this movie sold as a foreign movie, like Parasite was? If I want to read I'd get a book. Movies are a visual medium and although there are rare examples, like the aforementioned Parasite where the movie might be significant enough to make the odd exception I want my movie watching experience to be focused on looking at the acting, cinematography, sets etc. Not a ticker tape of text at the bottom of the screen. So that's how to write 600 characters on a 15 second movie. Crushed it!",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I can't believe that this movie has 8,2 score raiding. Really????

I tried really hard to watch it but thankfully i only wasted 40 minutes of my life.

This is probably one of the worst films i have tried to see.

PS. I can't believe the comments I have read about it.

The only laughable thing about all this, is the comments. This film should not be excised.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I agree with all the other 1 ratings. (Wish I could have rated it a 0!)

This movie had no redeeming value. And, the only reason I sat through the whole, excruciating, 2 hours and 12 minutes of it was because I thought my friend wanted to. (Turned out she thought as little of it as I did.)

How anyone in their right mind could find anything interesting about this film is beyond me.

I'm no aficionado of martial arts, but even that didn't seem well done, to me. Years ago, I saw several Jackie Chan movies, but, as I recall, the martial arts scenes were captivating; the ones in this movie just seemed like senseless violence.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"What a waste of my time. I like Michelle Yeoh and for me she was the only good thing in this movie. Was this a work of genius, or a quasi-clever wannabe something? Everyone to decide themselves, I just hope I would not have watched this, as this was the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot...

What puzzles me most is that how is it possible so many people give this movie such high ratings. Surely no-one can honestly say this was a great movie? Someone wrote about the emperor's new clothes. If the movie does not make any sense, is painful to watch and lasts forever, it must be great. Well, it is not.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"There is just too much change to grasp the overall story. Yes, pretty settings, fun characters, great optics. But please stick to something for more than 15 seconds. It have me a major headache. I love to watch complicated plots, and the multiverse is very complicated, but this is loud, hard to follow and not fun. The main characters are not likeable, go not give you reason to care about them, or how they end up. Its a long, loud cacophony of screeching birds that cant sing a pretty or harmonious song. I was trying so hard to engage, but it pushed back on me every moment I watched. What a shame, moms rule, but this was a tragic, epic slog.",1
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"It is disgusting. Senseless, tasteless, talentless, animelike, over the top stupid, naive, degenerative, unfunny and boring. I heard that people talk good about this movie, that they admire it, but i don't have a clue what they've found in this vomit. Seriously, even considering most people like and call bad movies 10/10 masterpieces, this one is even worse. People just can't stop happily eating excrements.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"And low budget meaning - they saved on every possible aspect of a movie - plot, story line, dialogues, acting, consistency, logic, while being generous with fight scenes, ridicoulous costumes and scenery, 'vilians' for sake of having vilians so somebody can fight, you name it.

And it narows down to family relationships and dynamics that could be placed in completely different context and without unnecessary accelerated shots, multivereses (and interesected with slow motion fight scenes).

All in all, it looks like super long SNL skit, and not a funny one.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,We were thoroughly enjoying this movie good graphics good acting originality seemed like it had everything going for it until the end. The grandfather with very traditional values it's told that his granddaughter is gay. Not only does this traditional grandfather not even get mad for a month a week a day or even a couple of minutes. This grandfather with very traditional values has a look wash over his face that could only be described as will there be a menagutwa and will I be in it. He actually look like Weinstein for a moment. You could tell that he was a grandfather from California that fell out of the cooch of a drug addict starlet.,2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This nonsense really is terrible. The typical oriental characters are so stereotypically racist. It's difficult to imagine why anyone like Michelle Yeoh or James Hong would get involved in something so bad. It actually a pity they made such a mess of what could have been a decent story. Admittedly it is a story involving the very much overdone multiverce theme, but it does have some fresh ideas. Unfortunately most of it is drivel. From the typically incompetent mall cops. To the comic book action rubbish. The performances are all very good, but the way the whole thing is put together leaves me confused and bored in equal measures. A waisted opportunity, badly done. One to miss, I think.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"2hrs36mins in the cinema, wasting my life at a film I can say is the only one that did less for me than Tenet. I didn't follow it, stopped wanting to and kept nodding off. This was the 're-released' version which basically had the additions of the Daniels' introduction where they came across as two spoiled students trying to be funny and 8 minutes of very boring and unfunny outtakes following the credits. It seems like these are two trusted filmmakers who have had money thrown at them and been allowed to indulge some drunken student fantasies. Definitely not for me.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This was a frustrating nonsensical seven shades of weird way to spend an evening. The opening scenes are boring and elongated waffle and then the film clumsily transitions into a pseudo wacky tacky kungfu psychedelic mess. The rave 10 out of 10 reviews have a whiff of the Emperor's New Clothes about them. Given the repeated Laundromat scenes you would expect that bad smell to go away but the film gets worse the longer it's allowed to go on. It's not arty it's just odd and poorly put together with crap characterization and zero screenplay. A dull scruffy dull scrappy disjointed nonsense. At the end of my days my Tombstone would read ""May have lives a little longer but was robbed of 2 hours of his life back in January 23. Oooof.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I am extremely surprised by how highly most people rated this movie - so I am obviously in the minority with this opinion .

I understand that the concept itself was interesting and there was even some funny parts - but overall it was confusing , dirty , stupid and just not good . I was intrigued the first 35 min but after that really forced myself through to the end . There was nothing cinematography pleasing about it.

A lot of better movies to watch - my advice is pick something else.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"It's the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I honestly don't understand those who recommended it to me so much. In a family drama disguised as a multivessal conflict. The big villain is simply a teenager with acceptance issues. A family that has to resolve their common conflicts or all the universes collapse. And how is the great multiversal conflict resolved??? Of course.... With the force of love!! ....My God, kill me! Two long and tedious hours of exaggerated and meaningless fights that end up dizzying or boring, I don't remember what happened to me first. The over-the-top performances are in keeping with the style of the film. I believe and I reiterate that it would not be so bad if they took away 45 min.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I gave it a second star because the acting was very good. Other than that the movie is close to being my least favorite movie ever. It makes me sad to think people thinks this is brilliant. I actually got the premise of the movie but it made me think of how teenage boys see the world. The Kung Fu fighting became monotonous and boring. I got that it represented the personal conflict in her real life. The scenes toward the end where they argued and shared and cried showed that. But sitting through two rocks talking to each other and the butt plug scene were just too much. I made myself sit through the whole thing so people who like this film couldn't say that I would have liked it if I had seen the whole thing.

If I had watched it in the theater I probably would have walked out at the butt plug scene. I know people think this is incredibly creative but again it was just silly and childish. I am sure if I were a fan of Kung Fu movies I might have appreciated the movie more. But still that scene and the dildo scene just made me think that adolescents had written the movie. No offense to adolescents.

The line where one of the main characters said can we please stop fighting resonated with me. I thought to myself yes please stop fighting. We got the point after the first 30 minutes of fighting.

The scenes with the movie star and her husband and the mother and daughter in the parking lot were brilliant. So much of the rest of the movie was just insulting and childish. I struggled through this more out of curiosity than anything else. Now I need to watch something else to try and forget how annoying and disappointing this movie was for me.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Good movie, but wish there were more black people.

""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, is a cinematic spectacle that has garnered widespread acclaim for its inventive storytelling, stunning visuals, and emotional depth. The film's unique blend of genres-combining elements of science fiction, martial arts, and family drama-sets it apart from the typical Hollywood fare. However, while it succeeds in many areas, there is a notable and significant shortcoming: the lack of Black representation.

The film centers around Evelyn Wang, a Chinese-American immigrant played by Michelle Yeoh, who is swept into a multiverse-spanning adventure that forces her to confront her failures, both personal and cosmic. The narrative explores themes of identity, generational trauma, and the immigrant experience, and it does so with a diverse cast that reflects the multicultural reality of contemporary America. The film's focus on the Asian-American experience is undoubtedly significant and represents a step forward in Hollywood's ongoing struggle with diversity. Yet, the film's celebration of diversity feels incomplete without the presence of more Black characters.

In ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" the representation of Black characters is minimal. Despite being a film that prides itself on breaking boundaries and exploring the idea of infinite possibilities, it falls into the common Hollywood trap of sidelining Black voices and stories. The few Black characters that do appear are relegated to minor roles, lacking the depth and nuance afforded to other characters. This oversight is particularly glaring in a film that deals so explicitly with the concept of inclusivity across different dimensions and realities.

Hollywood has a long history of underrepresenting Black people in films, especially in genres like science fiction and fantasy. These genres offer vast possibilities for world-building and imagination, yet they often fail to include Black characters in meaningful ways. ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" could have been an opportunity to challenge this norm by integrating Black characters into its narrative fabric, given its premise of exploring multiple universes. The absence of Black characters in significant roles perpetuates the industry's problematic pattern of excluding Black voices from narratives that are not explicitly about race.

This lack of representation is particularly disheartening when considering the film's broader message about the importance of diversity and embracing different perspectives. The multiverse concept serves as a metaphor for the richness of the human experience, suggesting that every possibility and every perspective matters. However, by not including Black characters in substantial roles, the film inadvertently suggests that certain perspectives are less valuable or less central to the human experience. This undermines the film's message and leaves a gap in what could have been a more fully realized exploration of inclusivity.

Moreover, the film's exclusion of Black characters is a missed opportunity to address the intersections of race, identity, and power in a more nuanced way. In a film that deals with issues like generational trauma and the immigrant experience, the inclusion of Black characters could have added another layer of complexity to these themes. The Black experience in America is one that is deeply intertwined with questions of identity, belonging, and survival-issues that are central to the film's narrative. By excluding Black characters from its central storyline, the film misses out on the chance to explore these intersections and create a more inclusive narrative.

The lack of Black representation in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is not just a problem of optics; it reflects a broader issue within the film industry. Despite the progress that has been made in recent years, Hollywood still struggles to include Black voices in a way that is meaningful and impactful. Films like ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" that are praised for their innovation and inclusivity need to hold themselves to higher standards when it comes to representation. True diversity means including all voices, not just those that are convenient or trendy.

In conclusion, while ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is an ambitious and groundbreaking film in many respects, its lack of Black representation is a significant flaw. The film's exploration of the multiverse is imaginative and engaging, but it falls short in its commitment to inclusivity by sidelining Black characters. In a world where representation matters, this oversight cannot be ignored. Hollywood needs to do better, and films like this need to lead the way in ensuring that all voices are heard and all stories are told.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I thought it was basically daft. I could see there was imagination behind it, but I just wasnt engaged with any of it - characters, storyline - nada. I cant think of any other film I have picked and paid specifically to watch that has been allowed to meander on over a couple of sittings, over a couple of days. And that's because it didnt interest me. Sorry. Im suppised to wax lyrical for another 300 characters, but I've nothing more to say.

Everything Everywhere All at Once,"He had to find his escape and defeat the machines that had imprisoned his reality.

Evelyn was the chosen one in her reality. She had to face the implications of her actions on her family, find love and existentialism, and defeat the disconnection and nihilism within herself and her daughter.

One of these stories blends philosophical themes, exciting action, compelling characters, and emotional resonance. The other is trying too hard to have the same themes.

It's pretty obvious to me why it's not my type of film. However, it terrifies me that so many people seem to praise it.

I enjoy being immersed in the character's feelings and feeling the emotional power the story brings. While some people argue that there is emotional power in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" I just couldn't get immersed in the movie because it has too many layers that are often ludicrous and childishly weird. It's hard to take something seriously when it isn't trying to be taken seriously.

What really shocked me was that people were crying and having existential meltdowns after watching the movie, and I don't understand how that's possible.

I cried at the end of La La Land because of how much you can relate to the characters' longevity of a relationship and that ultimate approval nod as they understand each other. It is a moment that is both horribly shocking and realistic in how it portrays the different directions life can take people.

I cried at the end of Whiplash because when Neeman and Fletcher lock eyes, it is their first moment of solidarity. It represented a moment of intense emotional release and resolution that we, as the audience, had to endure non-stop throughout the film.

I cried at the end of Breaking Bad again because when Walt and Jesse look at each other for that final time, we feel the complicated and often tumultuous relationship they had for so long between them. It is a culmination of their journey together.

These films stay within one lane, one relationship, and one clear goal, which makes it easier for the audience to feel the emotions they bring. ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" couldn't recreate that because it had too much being said, and there were too many layers of interpretation.

""The Emperor's Clothes,"" is a short morality story written in the late 1800s about an Emperor who is obsessed with the new clothes that this famous weaver has made for him. He parades the streets of his Kingdom wearing his new clothes to celebrate, and all the men and women of his kingdom cheer and approve of his new fit. That is until a child points out that the emperor is, in fact, naked and not wearing any clothes. The facade is up, and at that moment, the emperor and his kingdom altogether realize the same fate. That he is, in fact, naked, and the clothes do not exist. But they were allowed to exist because of their faith and trust in the famous weaver. Rather than their faith and trust in their own perception.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Terrible movie, disappointed that I had to pay to rent it, reviews said it was great, far from it. Don't waste your time, money or energy.

It drags around the same environment continually, for the first part of the movie, after a while I had to turn it off, it was going nowhere.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I watched the movie after it won the best actress Golden Globe.

I had high expectations.

I read so many great reviews, people saying what a great movie this is.

Unfortunately it is only a great mess.

The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is somehow original.

But it was unbearable. Terrible plot,terrible cinematography.

It looked like a fan made movie.

Some scenes were totally awful and hard to watch.

It was quite gory and disgusting.

I could not watch it until the end ,and even if I did, my opinion would not change. No ending can save an unwatchable movie.

I suspect that many people were paid to leave great reviews.

It is trashy.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"A few funny moments, some Scifi inspired elements, and insane violent action scenes that distracts you from the deeper meaning, if any. You can always find some lessons from certain parts, but you have to do the whole work yourself.

If a movie has to be explained and be watched with a guide to be able to follow it and get it, then I don't care to watch it.

I like to watch a movie where we have to figure out things and they don't overexplain every detail, but here I got the impression that the more confusing the made it the better they felt it would be, like the whole goal was to only be artistic yet pointless.

I felt a huge let down from a over hyped movie, I expected some universal qualities and didn't find then, when the movie finished it was a strong anti climax, just wasted an evening with that nonsense.",2

Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I kept hearing how great this movie was and that it was ground-breaking, best movie since the matrix. I realize people have different tastes, but this movie was not for me. It was so bad that after about 40 minutes I could not force myself to watch anymore. The reviews are also artificially inflated on amazon as well...Amazon doesn't let you review the movie unless you watch the whole thing, so guaranteed there are other people who would rate it low but their reviews are not allowed. For reference which movies do I like: Fight Club, The Matrix are probably my favorites. TV series: I loved DEVS and Breaking Bad.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Let me start by saying that I loved all the actors! They really did a magnificent job with the material they had. Frankly, I wish I could see them more often in more movies because they are real good.

I literally do not understand why this movie is considered as ""great, amazing and revolutionary"". It's really a disjointed story with no plot. Some even called it ""eccentric""!, But it really reflects on today's moviegoers attention span to follow a story, or have patience on how it builds up. The way it was edited, it was almost like scrolling through Instagram!

Wait until it streams save your money.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This movie could've been told in half the time. It is the definition of self indulgent. There are a couple lovely sequences, but this film could have been told in 35or 40 minutes and not be over two hours it is. If I was in a theatre I think I would have walked out. Although I love the actors, and the ideas I cannot recommend this film.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This is one of those pretentious drivel that everyone is keen to gulp down and rate 10/10. The speed of things going on is ridiculous. Then you have scenes where the lights are flashing as if to induce a seizure. Lastly, you have long drawn out scenes in either slow-mo or super slow dialogue. The movie is way too long for its own good and loses its charm by the 30 minute mark.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The Guardian review para-titled ""Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time"", remains the most accurate review I have come across to date on this colossal waste of time, unless you actually read the plot synopsis that contains ""insane adventure"" and ""other universes"" and then still proceeded to watch two hours and twenty minutes of gen Z hyper nonsense.

This failed attempt at inspirational movie making from an industry largely bereft of an original thought, will no doubt feed the coffers of its producers, by those still caught up in over-hyped media messaging, delusional story lines, and possibly kaleidoscopes.

Gen Z Oscar bait if ever there was one.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Maybe I had very high expectations but I really disappointed.

Many people said that this movie is ""funny"" but I felt embarrassing 13yo American teenage boy humour.

The ""message"" of this movie isn't that unique, very basic Too many ""action scene"" made it boring.

I think people liked it because they can relate to that 'family issues' and maybe that's why they cried. I've seen a lot of reviews that this movie made them cry and I'm a very emotional person but I didn't cry at all.

The movie effects were good tho. Even tho I don't know anything about 'effects', I actually liked it.

Lastly, actors and actresses did very well!",2

Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Ok I'm still trying to work out if it's the antibiotics and night nurse I'm tripping with or if that film is just insane. Egotistical rubbish that is trying to be 'different'. Much better films out there that do it so much more creatively. Didn't realise until I read a review after and it's by the same people who did the Swiss Army Man film with Daniel Radcliffe. That was tripe too.

1 star for costume and make up 1 star for the chap from the Goonies

Watch it but be warned you will not get 2 plus hours back of your life.",2
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"... cause there's pretty much a bit of everything. Everything Everywhere All At Once is a genre-bending multiverse film, it's a non-stop action, comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi, thriller and a little bit of romance. It's the kind of film that you're not really sure how describe it to your friends when they asks what it's about. It's definitely a fresh, eccentric out of the box film of its genre.

It has decent story and very well acted but what strike my attention is the visual. It's definitely has the most extravagantly colorful striking cinematography and editing. Especially with the little budget they had (from what i heard cmiiw). It's definitely a strong OSCAR contender.

But with all that being said, with all these overtly colorful strong visual and heavy drama, at times it feels a bit too...much(?) Don't get me wrong, it's still an extremely well made film, but it feels a bit overwhelming to watch, even with only 2hr19min runtime.

Anyway, definitely a must watch.

9/10.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"There are two reasons why I wanted to see this movie. One, it had a high rating of 8.1 and two it was considered a high probability of being selected for the award of best film, for Michelle Yeoh for best actress, for Jamie Lee Curtis for best supporting actress and for Ke Huey Kwan for best supporting actor. While the acting awards seemed justified since the acting was good, I have very strong reservations about the best picture bit. The movie described in Wikipedia as an ""absurdist science fiction comedy drama"" is extremely difficult to sit through and a torturous watch for most of the time. It can be described as inane, bizarre, aweful, nonsensical, chaotic, crazy, strange, trite, mind numbing, cringe worthy and basically an assault on the senses which drains you physically and mentally. After the first 40 minutes starts the madness which gets worse with time. The fights, the VFX, the fast paced martial arts, the high decibel music are okay for some time but it gets excruciating if one has to sit through for 2 hour 19 minutes of runtime. I was disappointed big time. The background of a parallel universe with virtual reality didn't help to make things interesting and made it look strange. The disjointed, meandering and confusing narrative and the superfast editing pace had me flummoxed. What a mess it looked.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I suspect that if you 'get' this film, you'll love it. If you don't 'get' it, you'll find it quite painful to watch. I didn't get it.

And now I have to write 500 characters review for some reason.

Don't waste your money and time with this movie.

Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Movie tried too hard. Too long and boring.

Reminds me of the kids that say they are random and just do weird things.

Movie starts out interesting but it never explains most of the weirdest things that happen throughout the movie. I love weird movies but this one is just random, all over the place like they didn't know what to do once they developed their characters.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This movie was none of the things I thought it would be. Completely beyond me how this is receiving high ratings.

It's all over the place related to the rules it establishes for it's universe. Without spoiling anything there is no way you could randomly evoke an instance of yourself with specific sets of skills. It would take a million tries but with this... no.

If you put even the slightest thought into this it falls apart.

The other thing is they often go quite low brow with the humor and its usually not very funny. I did laugh a few times at random but most of the bits missed me.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Telling a coherent story and building emotional connections with the audience are at the bottom of the list for this twisted raunchy trek through what is essentially one long stylized action scene. Combining themes from horror genres and low-brow humour, this is one film that attempts to mash a Christmas carol with nihilism and sex toys.

The writing is deliberately bizarre, with a story that is too convoluted for most, but don't mistake this for a deep philosophical film, nay, to the contrary, it has a social agenda (It's hard to find a film that doesn't these days). If you find plot devices like people having to do statistically improbable things like inserting a butt plug in the middle of a fight scene, or beating someone with a pair of oversized artificial genitalia funny, then by all means you may find this entertaining. If however you find such things deeply offensive, or pretentious, then this is one film probably left alone.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Boring and random, What is the deal with the stupid bagel?

I have no idea why the rating is so high, it's basically an ok film, with many scenes I had to fast forward due to its boringness and predictable scenes.

I was waiting for something to happen, but, nothing happened for over two hours in. I read people say it's soooo crazy but it's not ""crazy"" it just feels very random and idiotic.

Was really waiting for it to be over just so I can see something else, they could have made it much better and less childish, I guess people liked it because of the whole multiverse idea, but this movie is just bad and a waste of time.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The main point of the story, that is, the hypothetical existence of multiple universes with all the lives you could have lived and being able to jump from one to the other, might be the basis for a good story. However, they decided to make a 100% wacky movie, with loads of visual effects, totally implausible endless kung-fu fighting, and very very little story. The sub-plots get also lost here: the gay daughter coming out of the closet to her conservative grandpa, the immigrant Chinese family, who had to adapt to the US and is struggling with the IRS. There's stuff here to tell a real story, and no need to flashy visual effects.

Add to this dubious production choices. Both main characters are portrayed by actors who are Cantonese speakers, but in the movie they are depicted talking in Mandarin to each other and in Cantonese to the grandpa. This won't impact English speaking viewers, but it only makes sense to add more confusion to the Chinese audience.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I saw this film being nominated for an award, so I thought I would give it a whirl. Jamie Lee Curtis and Yeoh plus a recommended story line, I had high hopes. It was over 2 hours of my life I will not get back. It is confusing, difficult to follow and exhausting as the film jumps between subtitles and English. I guess that the story was well intentioned and there is obviously a huge following who enjoyed the film and its randomness. It certainly ranks high in the 'weirdness' scale. Somewhere in the multiverse there is a version of this which I will understand, but I fear that no matter how times that I watch this, its popularity baffles me.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,I can't help but mention The Lobster since I don't remember disliking a film as much since The Lobster . And I sat through this one thinking the same thing.. are we there yet? Will it ever end ? What's it about anyway? Did someone slip her a drug I didn't notice ? Was it caused by one of those games you put on your head and on her it triggered an unending distortion of reality? How about a nervous breakdown ? But then I'm told to not take it too seriously ??!! In college I never understood the books we had to read on symbolism. Is this a dose of that?? I give credit to the actors but that's where it ends . I hated it just like The Lobster .,3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"My wife and I waded through about 25 mins of this horrid mess, just waiting for a movie to appear, it did not.

Why this poorly scripted waste of talent was labeled in part a comedy / adventure is no more than false advertising.

To say this movie is a disjointed mess is a compliment. We are still trying to understand why it was even made and whether or not the writer was high on drugs when writing it.

A real stinker in every way.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This is probably the worse ""serious"" movie I have ever seen in my lifetime. Completely bizarre, no sense at all, everything mixed with no script, even if you change the editing, it might not affect the final result. Is a waste of time, more than 2 hours. Expendable one!",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"IMDB ratings usually align with what I like or don't like, but this is unfortunately an exception where I think the imdb rating is way overhyped.

First of all, I DO get this movie. I understand what it is trying to express, and I have no problem following the story (if you call it that) throughout the plot. BUT, the story is no doubt weird, and at times, unnecessarily gross and slightly disturbing. I just think the philosophical questions that the movie is trying to explore can be done in a MUCH more relevant way (like, fighting with dildo's? Making universe jumps by poking your own ass? .... really?) ... you wonder how sober the script writer was.

And when i watched the movie, I couldn't help checking my watch cause the movie felt slow and boring, and I noticed quite a lot of people left the theater half-way through too. In hindsight, I should have too, now that's 2 hours I can never get back in my life.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I'm so sick of the multiverse plot.

I'm convinced that a group of writers get together, take mushrooms, write down their trips, come back to reality, dump all their notes into a blender, hit ""high"" and pour out a steaming glass of ridiculous, confusing chaos.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Obviously this is a film you either love or hate. I am the latter. Ok, some of the acting may be brilliant and the special effects good. But the story is disjointed to nonexistent and at times really stupid. An existential bagel, hotdog fingers, living rocks. I ask you! This was either thought up by people with warped minds or on drugs. I'm now looking for a quantum physicist to explain the plot and a psychologist to help me get over it This film has already scooped numerous awards and will no doubt do well at the Oscars. As a mere movie viewer I'm very pleased I saw this free on Prime Video rather than fork out my hard earned cash at the cinema.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Let me start by saying, there were eventually a few redeeming factors in the end. However, this seemed like It was written by a drug addict while high & sober.

It means much more if you're married or a parent. There were so many confusing, fast paced scenes of ridiculous vulgar comedy. The sexually overt comedy was confusing & hilarious. They were honestly unnecessary to the main plot , which I had to piece together. I'll be called a blind knuckle dragged for this honest opinion. But these obtuse art films only impress the high & mighty pseudo intellectual.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The Good reviews for this has to be robots because that movie was not very good. The concept was great but the delivery was not. Hot Dog Fingers, Really? Racoon chefs, Really? Everything Bagel Black Hole , Really? When i watched the preview, this nonsense was not part of it. If it was i wouldnt have gone. Best summed up by my wife who after it looked over at me and gave me a dirty look and said , there is 2 hours of my life ill never get back. Believe the people who gave this a 1 over the ones who gave it a 9 or higher.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"....but have options. Everything, Everywhere, All at Once (EEA from this point forward) had been critically acclaimed and is now been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (not that it means anything any longer). For me, that meant I had to view it-in its entirety- to give a fair assessment of the film. I had my reservations going in, I'm really not fond of martial arts- although I'm a fan of both Kill Bill films- and I view stories about the multiverse as generally offerings that use the concept as a crutch because they can not tell a coherent story based in the one universe we all live in. After hearing all the praise and accolades that were applied to this film across the board, I figured I would have to at least acknowledge that, although this was not my cup of tea, the film was pretty good. What a shock it was, then, to find myself embroiled in such a juvenile exercise with such a simplistic meaning. Two hours and twenty minutes of sturm and drang (all at volume 11) to come up with ""There's no place like home""? There is actually a scene of two rocks talking to each other- seriously, two rocks- well there ARE two Daniels after all. Suspend your disbelief to accept thousands of other universes for ""All you need is love""? When I suspend my disbelief, it comes at a price-EEA fails to pay that price and has a sophomoric sense of humor that one might find in the subgenre of porn/comedy (see Flesh Gordon) that almost makes me think it's a neo-comedy (you know, the ones where you never laugh- because there's nothing funny). It's truly disturbing to see how the film has connected with so many younger people- although juvenile and simple is the way to go these days. This is certainly not a film for serious adults and my advice is: if you think you're going to hate this film, you're probably right- certainly DO NOT PAY in any way to see it, and have a back up film ready to watch that could save your movie night if you dare venture in. Just remember that Everything Everywhere All at Once could also be an accurate description of projectile vomiting (used in the film) or explosive diarrhea- wonder how the later failed to make the cut in here.

P. S. The use of Debussy's. Clair De Lune in this film is an actual abomination- pearls before swine.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,I would describe the first 27 minutes as something between Gilmore Girls and Spanish soap opera with English/Chinese language mix and try-hard superficial humor which I kinda tolerated. Few minutes later there is a full-blown overexaggerated Bollywood-fight-type scene which was my cue to stop watching.,3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"But everything else was honestly not it for me. I found it confusing, and slow. The first few scenes were a complete mimic of the Matrix when Neo is in the offices being chased at the very start. I found it was really a combination of many of my favourite movies. From the Matrix to Dr Strange to Any SciFi about universe jumping. Though the performances were fantastic, the storyline was too boring for me, or just not good enough ? We didn't get to experience the other people's lives, we didn't get to experience their world and so it was tough feeling the way that the main actress was suppose to be feeling. While easy to feel the doom of the other characters as we could find ourselves in them. To bring hope, they should have shown more of it.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I thoroughly enjoyed the actors' performances - and they should get credit for giving compelling performances in a movie that made absolutely no sense at all. If you were simply to focus on their relationships with one another, and the complicated, painful, dynamic, beautiful intricacies of those relationships, it would be a 10/10 - but this movie is just a total mess. There is no actual plot. It's as if someone obsessed with special effects met up with someone obsessed with action sequences and decided to make a movie and they completely forgot to tell any kind of story. The symbolism and allegory are not lost on me but - again - there is no cohesive story that binds all of the crazy together into one meaningful movie. As a result, it was a chore to watch. I was very disappointed and am truly mystified about all the awards it won aside from the acting recognition.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This story went nowhere over and over again every time you started to hope it was going to make a solid point that didn't end in the wrong orifice.

It's not humorous enough to be Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and it's not clever enough to be The Matrix. It was little better than a silly allegory of itself and its writers-which we would do well to avoid like their proverbial Everything Bagel.

The humor was not merely preadolescent; it subtexted all the sad single-tracked fetish of a sexually abused child.

Speaking of sophomoric things, the visuals, while fascinating enough to be alluring in a trailer, were literally one flashy lighting or Photoshop trick after another, and should earn you no better than a C- in undergraduate film school.

Save yourself, save your daughter, and spare the overplayed multiverse by finding a much better movie to watch.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"A random movie I seen on the discount shelf. I decided I like a good random flick.

Oh boy... It's just another Matrix, Inception movie.

January 22 2023

About: A Chinese lady living in the USA is drawn into random stuff. Why? I don't know.

Story and production: it's another confusing sown up movie. Why? Who? What? Is happening I can not answer.

The quality I good. It's a creative movie.

The Wayne guy and some parts reminds me of William Janus from South Park. Where William Janus turns out to be Tuong Lu Kim who has multiple personality disorder.

Overall, a creative movie though its confusing me.

Genre: Sci-Fi, Chinese.

Soundtrack: It good.

Duratiom: 2 long bloody hours...

What can be learned? Do you really control your reality?

Should you watch this? Meh... If your confused by Matrix and Inception then that's what you'll Get. A headless dog... Haha!

I don't know what people see in these types of messy movies. Maybe it's the randomness or someone getting beat by a Private part. I didn't laugh once because I thought it was nasty.",3
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The moral of the story, you can fix your relations with your family members, on several plains of multiple universes, you can get away with plenty of murders and get forgiveness, you can defeat an undefeatable adversary, but you can't escape taxes. That's a strong message. Apart from that, only clichés stolen from another movies, Matrix, Scary movie 5, all the other multiverse movies. Too long on the morality scenes, too boring since we knew how's gonna end a mile away. A solid 5, but far from ""The best movie of the year"". Women power, of course, It could not be the other way. My 2 cents. 4 stars.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This is actually a very important film to remember. A turning point in Hollywood if I may call it.

The movie revolves around homosexuality which is profoundly frowned upon in Chinese culture, but finally it seems the family kinda accepted the situation. Then at the end the mother's hint to Becky as to grow her hair, leaves a doubt so there won't be total acceptance and the new truth has to comply to centeric family's way after all.

All the fuss is about centerism the entire length of the film. It seems China has tried to strip Hollywood of its cultural influence as a broadcaster for American way, and using it to his own advantage. So with all the nominations from Oscars, it seems there will be more of this to come in coming years.

The movie is promoting the Chinese way so obviousely and especially present it as an alternative to American dream. Freedom and letting go is bad, and sticking to the centric family as Chinese culture suggest is a better option (at least what is they want us to believe of Chinese culture at this point).

Altough it has been entertaining with an action packed and distracting storyline and showing some acceptable storytelling proficiency, but it leaves no doubt this is defenitely a propoganda towards China and how the world shall accept it and BE KIND!.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I had to watch the movie in two parts since I couldn't make it all the way through the first time. I noticed on the streaming service, that I could resume watching so I finished the movie. Visual aspects are pretty amazing. That's a movie keep shifting from place to place in rapid succession. I admire the actors for all the changes they had to go through essentially making multiple movies at once.

All the cinematic pyro technics overwhelm a simple message that really doesn't emerge on the last minutes of the movie. Is the acting that good? Obviously award selectors thought so, but the movie doesn't allow the actors to stay in anyone character along enough to really allow them to act.

It may be the ultimate movie for the TikTok generation.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"If you have seen more films, you will surely consider the level of this film to be average. The interesting parts of this film were struggles, traveling in a parallel world and comedy.

If I had the ability to make a film like this, I would definitely make the best one. Of the two hours of the film, only thirty minutes were useful, the script was strong and the subject matter of the film was interesting.

The actors played well, but the choice of actors for the roles was awful. In this film, more than showing the art of acting, more technological effects were used and it was very imaginative.

And the best part was the concept of living and being together, which was useful.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I can confidently say that this was one of the most insane movie experiences that I have ever been though. The key word here is experience- as it is not a film which you can simply 'watch'.

First things first- I can appreciate this as a great ode to filmmaking and a great example of it- it's a stunning work of visual art which twists every rule about film in a bonkers and entirely unique way.

Yet I simultaneously felt like I was going to combust with pure anxiety while watching it. Strobe effects warning? I think this film needs a heart condition warning. At one Kubrick-esque moment, me and my friend nearly (literally) pissed ourselves laughing. I involuntarily found myself shouting several profanities in pure awe, chaos, disgust and hilarity. This film had my body reacting in ways that I didn't think a film could, which was easily worth the ticket price and the act of watching it.

Towards the end though, I just wanted to get out of the theatre, go to the loo and catch my breath- which I think is both an amazing sign and quite a horrific one. The film's message really didn't hit me- but I don't really mind that it did, and am glad that many people found something within it. Because what I found was one of the most insane film experiences I have ever been subject to.

Now, let's calm down and have a nice cream cheese bagel.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Very interesting concept, very well presented, this is something new I must admit. Some kind of psychedelic-bloody-slightly perverse atmosphere works here with some kind of forced and partial perverted comedy that is not funny at all. There is some action throughout the film, if we can call it action at all, the description says it's an adventure, but I didn't see any trace of adventure here. It's immediately obvious that this definitely is not for everyone taste. I'm bothered by the bilingualism that drags through the film, it's somehow disorienting and uninteresting. The actors did their job properly, the only thing I don't like is the portrayal and characteristics of the character played by Stephamie Shu, that role sets the film back quite a bit and makes it uninteresting in parts and boring. All in all, I partly see why the rating of the film is so high, but I think that the rating is definitely not fully justified, this is a mediocre time killer with some boring and uninteresting scenes and nothing more.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I really didn't expect the intensity of the violence in this film or the edgy sexual content; the trailer didn't really suggest this and it caught me off guard. I didn't feel well about halfway through the film: the theater sound was super loud and the violence continuous. Why is everything today blood, guts and sexual torment? No wonder society is so lost.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Entertaining but off the mark. Written by a person who doesn't understand themself. Narcissism is caused by lack of genuine parental engagement. Resulting in maladjusted psycho sexual development. It's not that your parents don't like that you're gay, it's that you parents are so self absorbed they don't care at all.

The reason I'm being harsh is. Thee conclusion of the movie is actually harmful. It's maladaptive perfectionism which is common in narcissistic abuse. Most of the movie is what would be the reaction of an abused person. Basically a healthy person would reject the premise and not try to save everyone. You're the unibomber and I'm going to have healthy boundaries even if you're my family.

If you don't believe me the multiverse is what happens when you're abused and your psyche implodes because you're regressing in an attempt to cope with the circumstance. You're living in a narcissists false reality and it's very unhealthy. Self improvement is an individual task and you should remove yourself from narcissists. That's healthy behavior. They're sad destructive people that are black holes. Fun movie bad message.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Love, love the first third of this movie. Such great characters, interesting buildup, terrific interaction -- and then main character basically drops acid. For the rest of the movie, we more or less take the trip with her, with this and that hallucination (or not), characters seeming one way or the other, changing personality, dress, etc., midway and back and then again, then back. By half way through, it stopped holding me and I found myself becoming rather bored. Would have been much more interesting if it was my own trip but it wasn't, and I started fast forwarding little bits to see if I could see something else developing besides more hallucinations (or not). Effects were great, but to me was hard to make it to the end. Surprised at all the hype and best this and best that with exception of best actress.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This movie is Not bad, is Not going to save you life, is not going to change your life, because for those of us who've watched the animated TV Show ""Rick&Morty"" this movie is nothing new!!.... as a matter of fact, I call it ""Rick&Morty"" for newbies!! Haha.

In general the concept of Multiverses has been done many times (Including the TV Show ""Loki"") so there is not a lot new in here

The acting is good but I still insist it should've been Jackie Chan playing the husband!! He has a far longer and more interesting career than ""Ke Huy Quan"", Jackie Chan was ROBBED of that oscar and other awards!! Such an injustice!",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This movie was too long it got me weary and movies are not supposed to do that. This movie is not for general audiences that was clear. It is for a segmented group and even then, many may not see it for what it was; a cultural fusion of Asian / gay with a twist of alien philosophies that are based on a chaotic take on multiple universes. Think of this as two camps; one born out of Atheism and the other from religion. Religion views it as one universe that is orderly while the other chaotic. But this movie falls flat on its face because it proposes that from viewing / participating from a alternate, chaotic universe you could solve your earthly problems. This is not impressive philosophy but rather bland and flawed and the creators tried to make up for it with some feeble comic elements. Another nuisance was the constant barrage of fast cross cutting and cutaway in and out of parallel universes. This is only done one or 2 times preferably in the 3rd act to tie loose ends to give audiences insight into the character's feelings and thoughts, but here it felt like we are engaged in a video game.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The fact this movie has such a high rating makes me wonder how so many people thought this was a good movie. Did we even watch the same film?

The highlight of the movie is the ending (it's not great but at least there is a positive message) but everything else is just not good. The over the top aspects littered all in the movie just didn't do it for me. I'm not opposed to weird things and odd stuff happening as long as it makes sense or at least enhances the movie. This movie just had weird and, to me, very corny and cartoony things happening that made the movie feel lame and not intelligent, which a complex storyline should have. Just putting weird stuff for the sake of it doesn't make it work well and doesn't make the movie good.

I went into the movie not hearing about it from anyone who had seen it so I guess my expectations of the direction they were going to go was not in the right mindset. There were even a few parts that probably would have been funny if I wasn't so unimpressed with this film and that I spent over 2 hours on another movie that is hyped up and again was not good.

I give it 4 stars just because it is creative and the directing must have been difficult with so many odd things changing and happening all at once. But that is really being generous because I just didn't like the movie. The basis had potential but I think the director just really fell short on his delivery of concept. And if that is what the writers were going for then I am surprised people wanted to make it.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"I was very impressed with the acting of the 3 headline characters. They would each get a 9. Unfortunately, there was no story. It was all random, senseless, activities. Sure, you can figure out the ""plot"" - but why bother? The entitled producers of Hollywood owe the paying public more than this.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This movie has some Matrix vibes as the main character understands reality and learns how to manipulate that reality.

It had Cloud Atlas vibes because it's a disjointed hodgepodge..I couldn't handle Cloud Atlas, and hated this.

It has Emperor's New Clothes vibes, because I suspect that very few people actually understand this movie, and praise it because they don't want to seem dumb.

I've watched this twice, the second time trying to understand what I missed the first time, and I ended up dropping my rating from 6/10 to 4/10, simply because it's not the worst thing I've ever watched.

The fact that this movie is an Oscar frontrunner should have tipped me off that it was going to be a boring waste of time.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Honestly this was a waste of time. But that seems to be the case with Amazon Prime, nowadays. If it's not lousy shows then they bait and switch by giving you a free season and make you pay for season 2, or try to get you to sign up with partner streamers with free trails. Kind of greedy considering how much money Amazon makes.

It's amazing what people will watch nowadays and consider worthwhile entertainment. This concept had some valid possibilities to explore but the production was jarringly told and the bulk of time was spent on gratuitous fight scenes rather than in actually telling a story. The only redeeming factor in the whole movie was Michelle Yeoh. I could probably sit through an hour of her making biscuits and gravy. 4 stars and that is only for Ms Yeoh.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This is a film masquerading as a deep film, but whose depth is only apparent to someone who has only ever watched childrens' films.

40 minutes too long. Laid on far too thick. It's an allegory, we get it.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,The movie was so boring. I really thought it was gonna be somthing like the multiver but it was just same girl with different clothes. The movie was not trying to be serious at all. To long.,4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"It was a string of weird images and ideas about the multiverse without having a strong, engaging storyline or complex characters.

I was very disappointed as I love this sort of thing and the reviews were so strong.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Enthusiastic performances by all but jeez is this hard to follow. Definitely for a young audience. It's like a zombie apocalypse movie without the zombies.

Glad to see the guy from Indiana Jones doing stuff again but Jamie Lee Curtis , come on.

Michelle yeoh is good and I appreciate the efort involved but after half an hour Michelle says this doesn't make any sense and I know how she feels.

I wasn't sure what universe each character was in . It's pacy but unintelligible. Judging by the rating it must excite and please some people but for a 50 something it comes across as the kind of film my 9 year old would dream up . I mean what the actual frack is going on.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Is this a bad movie? No. Is it a good movie? Not really.

At its roots, the story is fairly simple: a woman finds out that she's the only one who can stop an evil(-ish) force. And she learns how to be a better person along the way. There aren't really any surprises as far as the story goes; it's a series of cliches that don't add up to much.

The action is basic. Nothing special, nothing particularly interesting. The humor is uncreative and lame: there's a Ratatouille spoof called Racacoonie (it's a raccoon); in an alternate universe, people have hot dog fingers; there's a bagel with literally everything on it... it feels like there's not a single idea that wouldn't fit on a Venn diagram crossover between dad jokes and things a teenager would think up while high.

The ending is the worst part. We know what's going to happen. We've seen it a thousand times before. But it just drags on and on and on. It could've easily shaved ten minutes off in the last half hour. Hell, maybe the whole last half hour could've been skipped.

I'd most recommend this for the ""film bro"" type and people who are shallow but think they're deep.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"It has its moments and entertaining parts. But this movie was over-hyped and in the end, is not a must-see movie. If you happen to catch it playing and there is nothing better on, then you may find some scenes here and there as fun and interesting. But overall, this movie will fade into obscurity because it's just not that good.",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,Funny movie but I feel it could have been much shorter as it became very long to sit and watch this to the end. They could have cut about 30 minutes of this movie and it would have been better IMO.,4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Being an Asian myself, having grown up watching Chinese Kungfu movies, and then Jackie Chan's Rush Hour, I understand how people, especially Americans, love Kungfu. And although Michelle Yeoh is very good at martial arts, and I also adored her for 'Memoirs of a Geisha', this is not a good Kungfu movie. The film's Kungfu performances are really boring and lifeless.

In terms of content, I find there are 3 aspects to evaluate this movie, one: the appeal of the story, two: the humor, the third: the emotion and the message.

About the story, the multiverse theory is explained in quite detail, but it seems that due to the low budget, what we see is only described through Waymond's words. And the little dots on the screen or whatever screen. It's too simple to enjoy. And the detail of the ear device for multiverse communication is ridiculous and meaningless. The character Becky and the grandpa ended up having no role at all, completely hopeless. Why is Joy the villain? The story goes on and on and forces the viewer to accept everything. The multiverse is something huge and has a very wide impact, but the story here revolves around only a few people? Wtf not to mention that there are some universes that are just created for the purpose of comedy and have no meaning, and that humor is, I will say, = Zero. I can't laugh a bit when I see the humor in this movie. If you want funny Kungfu movies, watch a movie by Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow.

Fortunately, this film has a message and emotion, which is the commendable point of the film. The editor of this movie is Paul Rogers and he deserves an Oscar, the universes are shown continuously, especially towards the end,the scenes are also constantly transferred between different universes making it nearly impossible for the viewer to adapt and keep up with what's going on everywhere, but the music ties it all together perfectly. I like the music in the movie. Especially at the end when the meaning of family is gracefully expressed. From the very beginning we know that family is the heart of the movie. Although everything is shown quite chaotic and a bit boring, but the feeling of family is well put so viewers can still feel it. But this is also what makes viewers like me feel quite uncomfortable, I don't know whether to enjoy this movie in a serious way or just for fun? So I would be quite hesitant if I want to watch this movie again. And although the acting of the actors are impressive, but 7 Oscars? Please... At this rate, in the years to come I'll probably stop believing in Oscars...",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"It seems there would be a lot of ways to tell a story of a woman learning to appreciate her life and that kindness and understanding can have a positive impact on those around her. I really liked the actors and where this tale ended but my gosh what a long, repetitive, flashy two hours to get to that point. As others have said: I was done with the Marshall arts, universe travel, ""comedy"" after about 20 minutes. It went on so long that I barely made it to the end. I wondered how people would choose this movie over Banshees of Inisheren or The Fabelmans as the best film of the year. It was too much!",4
Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Some parts of the movie were really funny, and the jokes on spot on many level. But the script of the movies, the changing scenes, without any logic... Do not get high and see this, you will loose your mind...in not a good way.

Worth watching it once in your life, at home, for free. After that forget that it is existing. Or not...

One more thing... Eat a bagel for breakfast once in a while.

Wasted like two hours of my life I'll never get back.

Who tf is named Hobbs?

It was pretty much the Rock bashing blokes and trying to find his family because the other guys had a friend who stole a diamond and wanted to burn down a tribe because they have an island.

And idris Elba is in it?",1
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Avoid at any cost. Completely nonsense. Copied from movies here and there has no scenario or whatsoever script. Brainless action unrealistic futuristic action..,1
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I went in with low expectations and was still amazed at how bad it was. I've seen all of the Fast and Furious movies and usually find them entertaining. They are movies that dont require much concentration but still keep me amused. I sat through over 2 hours of Hobbs & Shaw and was never amused or entertained once! It's about what I would expect from Jason Statham but expect more from Dwayne Johnson. The story was weak, characters even weaker and dialogue juvenile.",1
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I rented this movie for free, and I want my money back. The chemistry between the two leads is non-existent, with every joke falling flat and every line of dialogue being painful to listen too. The action was laughably unbelievable and that's from an action movie standpoint. Sorry Dwayne, you're not strong enough to hold a helicopter. Mcguffins are a'plenty which is par for the course with these movies since the 4th installment, but it doesn't make it any less egregious and mind numbing. The small amount of romantic sub plot was bafflingly underdeveloped if not completely missing, and once again the actors had no chemistry. The overall theme of the movie(if you could call it that) was that technology doesn't trump human spirit and heart. Which I found hilarious considering the way they showed it was with samoans winning a battle against advanced soldiers(after their weapons got turned off) when polynesian culture was almost completely wiped out by cultures with more advanced technology. History disproves your theme, sorry. Overall the movie was a big, expensive, shiny and polished nothing. With nothing of note to remember and nothing worth saying. I wish I could rate it less.",1
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Painful to watch... Dross acting coupled with pointless montages and fist bumping. I'd normally appreciate the mindless escapism if it was supposed to be tongue in cheek.... with humour thrown in. Such a waste of a very capable cast.,1

Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"This movie is SOOOOO cheesy and such a, ""B movie!!!"" The Rock is a good actor and I don't understand why he's in this cheap I'm stupid Bee movie with its ""IMPOSSIBLE,""stunts!! So so fake!!!!!

American's are tired of these macho stupid B movies! There's so many Brit actors here that are taking American jobs. At first, their accents were cute but, now, it has become hideous to American's ears!!! Too many Brits in America, and their accent are no longer cute!!! Go back to England I stopped taking Americans jobs!",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"They Should have changed the title of movie to something else, as it is nothing related to same except 3 shots max.. that too disappointing you can predict in advance what is going to happen next..

If you have any other option, ANY other movie, you should choose the other movie. Trust me. If you are not 12 years or younger, or have a child's mind, you will not enjoy this mindless stupidity. The fact that this vomit fest cost a ridiculous 200 million dollars is just insane. WTF?!! I don't know what's more scary, that someone in the business can read the script for this muscle and guns party and go ""Yeah bro, right on man, i'll put in 200 million dollars on this movie, yeah!"". Or the fact that the movie earned 60 million dollars in 4 days....... Vomit. By the way, Dwayne, no one ever told you about over exposure? I wouldn't mind seeing ANYONE else in a big budget leading role!",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,I can't understand all of the good reviews and the fact that people say it's a brilliant spinoff Fast and Furious! It's a shame that they allowed this film to be made. It's a bad movie and it shouldn't have the name of the franchise on it,2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I couldn't finish watching because it had so much unrealistic stunts. Depictions that are completely detached from reality. I get it's now become a supernatural/superhuman movie but even the ""natural"" cast with no superhuman strength/power perform stunts that would definitely kill them but they emerge with not even a scratch. Whoever directed this movie is one of those immature adults who play with dolls at home",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Cringe Hollywood classic. I called everything in the movie before it happend. Like the haka dance in the end fight, the rock holding a chopper with his biceps. Etc just how can ppl give this moren than 2 stars??",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Poor jokes and a bunch of macho stuff. Almost science fiction, but without the science.

The heroes live in a parallel world where physics does not apply to them. Also, they are outside all laws, they are the most capable and the smartest. A classic Hollywood product without any brains.

Statham and Rock aren't acting, they're just smiling, gritting their teeth and showing off their muscles. They are the same in every movie. The blonde is cute, but her role is pointless like all the others. Idris Elba can do more than this, but he's clearly in it for the money. The appearance of Reynolds and Hart is absolutely pointless. I don't know what was in the minds of the screenwriters except emptiness.

The entire F&F universe is a bad joke.",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Fast and the Furious = Witty, action, family, attention catching, non intellectual entertainment. Anyone reviewing and giving this a low rating simply because it's not an epic drama should probably turn away from the series, as the series is not trying to capture that audience.

I myself went into this film expecting all the joys, jumps and rides I've come to expect based on the previous films. Whilst this is a ""spin-off"", it came across as a bunch of actors trying to cash in on the franchise. Whilst there is nothing wrong with that, the audience would come to expect corny comedy and action from these characters which the movie does deliver on. However the film itself is simply boring in comparison to anything in the Fast and Furious franchise. The actors have delivered on what is expected of them, however the story itself seemed well beyond far fetched (even for a Fast and Furious movie).

It seemed like a cross between a James Bond film, and Superman returns with a touch of sound effects from a Transformers movie.

It was nice to see a touch of culture thrown in with Samoa...then this was all destroyed by several ""idiotic"" scenes which followed which could have been done with a little more grace than to make Samoans simply look like brain dead barbarians that know only of family with the odd ""smart"" ball in the bunch.

Other than that, my 12 year old loved the movie. I on the other hand was simply disappointed.

If there is a sequel to this, I hope the producers engage a third party consultant to assist with what potentially can become a great franchise if done correctly.",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I cannot comprehend why anyone would spend time and money making this. Even less why anyone would pay to see it.

Surprised to see Elba take on a garbage role like this. Even Statham should know better.",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"As a parody it's great and funny...

As a spin-off it's a total piece of crap, illogical, senseless, pointless waste of time, full of lazy writing and way too cartoonish.. flame throwers don't blow people away...!",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"English Cockney 😭 my family couldn't understand when the English were speaking! Come on guys, really! You're going to have to pay really close attention when the English speak!!! I want my money back! Cuz I don't know what the hell it just watched????!",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Okay - this looked SOOOO good - and on balance it has some fairly decent action scenes- but Hollywood has to recognize that Jason Statham is not in the same league as someone like Iko Uwais or Yayan Ruhian and either start doing the shaky camera thing with his fight scenes - or give him much less martial artsy scenes. He looks like an old man in a bar fight for most of the movie.

The Rock is actually really good - but once again - our dialogue is provided by the new millennial and delivered in a script that has clearly gone through ""sensitivity"" editors. The Plot is extremely disjointed - and they really struggle to sew the whole thing together.

The WORST thing though - is that about half way through it basically becomes another movie - and that's basically a live version of Moana - and it's depressingly poor. I left the cinema when the Rock started doing his Samoan speech. I assume they all then launch into a Haka or the Siva Tau - didn't stay around long enough to see it.

For the most part - the acting is sort of bearable - but labors around an increasingly poor script - the kind where you can tell the writers think they are being really clever - but they lack the social skill or maturity to understand what makes people laugh so you just have these awkward Kevin Hart type moments that just annoy.

Idrs Elba saves every scene he is in and if he is NOT earmarked to play the next James Bond then the Broccolis should be utterly ashamed of themselves. He delivers every line perfectly - despite the poor quality of the writers - and makes a solid and thorouhly unlikable bad guy. Although the confusion on his face as an actor when he is in scenes that clearly should be reserved for the cloak and dagger baddie the Director (who if they were smart - they will not have revealed as being Agent Loeb until we get to the inevitable sequel). I missed the end of the film - but I know the bad guy gets defeated and Hobbs and Shaw end up primed for a sequel. Overall - I would give this a huge miss. Idris Elba and his motorcycle actually steal the entire movie.

I would definitely recommend waiting until this appears on Netflix if you feel you really MUST watch it.",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Unreal, impossible, stupid, just too much sci-fi - it was so bad I stopped watching after 25 min",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"This movie is terrible, i cant even explain how bad it is, i am currently writing this while watching it and i really can not beleive the high ratings fpr this junk",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I mean seriously. Is it because we expect it to be so embarrassingly bad that it turned out to be good in your opinion? The cheesy one liners, the cheesy Samoan scenes. The completely absurd shooting scenes. The choreography in fight scenes was okay and that's giving it a compliment. In what way does this relate to Fast&Furious? Basically just a dumb action movie. If action is what you're looking for, I'd suggest John Wick. But man this was bad. So bad. And amongst all that, I get that it would be great to make a funny action movie like bad boys 2 but childish insults back and forth throughout the whole movie are not necessary and not funny.",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Had absolutely nothing to do with the fast and furious franchise, mechanical men and transforming bikes, what a Farce.",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,This movie is ridiculous. It is against laws of nature. Wish they focused on cars as the early editions.,2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,From Shaw's 'Macho' voice to overworked one liners which I guess was there to attempt make this a fun movie. The only thing that keeps this movie afloat is the glimpses of Ryan Reynolds little parts which really show the riddiculousnesness of this movie in full swing.,2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,How is that the Bad Guy (Brixton) does not win one fight. Every encounter that Hobbs and Shaw has against Elba they come out in top. Movie was one-sided. It was a action packed movie and loved the USO story line.,2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"What a great waste of time and money. The last Fast and Furious movie was like 100 times better. Why are they still making these films when they don't have any story or plot or just about nothing to show as such. Saving the world!! That was a big joke in the movie. Utterly nonsense.

I could not stand to watch this movie for more than one hour. And that too was so uncomfortable. The whole movie was loud for no reason at all. I left the hall after interval and watching me leave another 7-8 people left the theatre.

Dissatisfied and disappointed. Very bad.",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Totally rubbish. Testosterone filled overblown drivel. Stunts that defy physics, CGI in place of a story. Dialogue is the worst kind of puerile drivel. Predictable, formulaic and unbelievable at every stage. Crashing a few vehicles, adding loud music and blowing stuff up does not make a movie.",2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Bad written script and boring joke. End up i left the cinema.,2
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"There isn't much you can expect from a movie such as this. Everyone knows the typical, you get the chases, fights, and firefights. Plot wise its a generic big evil trying to end the world, pin two characters who have a disagreement in order to produce the hi jinx. Now while that produces your average action film, the ending is a mess, making it feel as if the movie had not one director but 20 all trying to shove their style into it.

Had the movie continued the was it had been going and not have a weird useless continuation from the second act into a third one. The flow of the movie told us that the main villain played by Idris Elba will be killed, and the trio will go to destroy the entire ""shadow"" group from the top. But NO we continue into a 3rd act where all we see are illogical actions just in the name of the plot. Hobbs returning to his home while a good idea on the surface to make the movie feel more like a family one, makes little sense in the issues that they are facing. The end simply feels like a forced respect for the Polynesian culture just in order for fun moments.

In the end, the movie requires the viewer to completely detach themselves from reality, and logic. The movie fails us a spin off of the Furious collection of films as it fails to put the importance in family, and focuses on simple and unjustified however visually appealing shots. The movie does a good job in the first and second acts, yet destroys all that work in the third one.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Need to be honest this is not a fast and the furious movie I love both of the actors but the fact that this is an action movie With nothing to do with the fast and the furious previews movies I will give a low rating,3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"No suspance, only fight with no sense. Who can be happy in viewing this thing?",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"This is fast and furious not politic movie , only have 2 action part :)))) after paul walker everything is done!!",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I'm conflicted. As a massive fan of the F&F franchise I feel lobbying against all the fake reviews is against my self interest in case they stop making these movies. On the other hand, if this is how they insult our intelligence, maybe the series needs to die now so we can preserve it's greatness.

This has just become a cynical cash cow that truly insults our intelligence. The movie was so poorly scripted, so lazily executed that I thought it would conclude by the first hour then they dragged another hour out of it to extend my misery.

Honestly, half the movie was a montage of itself. Pausing to reflect how amazing it was.

If they just ran it as a comedy with Kevin Hart and Ryan Reynolds, they would have knocked it out of the park. Their 10min excellent cameos brought this back from the dead. What a waste of great talent from The rock, Statham and Helen Mirren.

Please try harder next time guys.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Just let fast and furious die already damn Tokyo drift was the best dawg...dont play with me,3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"" is a disappointing addition to the Fast & Furious franchise, earning a mere 3 out of 10. Despite the film's high-octane action and star-studded cast, it fails to deliver a coherent plot or engaging storyline.

Jason Statham's performance is notably lackluster. His portrayal of Deckard Shaw lacks the charisma and depth required for the role, making his character feel one-dimensional and unconvincing. His acting, often filled with exaggerated bravado, comes across as forced and ultimately embarrassing.

The movie itself suffers from a weak narrative. The plot, if one can call it that, is disjointed and riddled with implausibilities. The action sequences, while visually impressive, cannot compensate for the film's overall lack of substance. The story makes little sense, and character motivations are either poorly explained or entirely absent.

Overall, ""Hobbs & Shaw"" is a chaotic, nonsensical film that fails to entertain. Its over-reliance on spectacle without a solid foundation in plot or character development results in a forgettable and unenjoyable viewing experience.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Unbelievably unrealistic, over effects average movie which cannot touch any past Fast and Furioua movie. Another movie without ""soul"" and a proof , that special effects does not make a good film.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Have some respect for Paul Walker and stop already! Just greedy. Movie isn't worth it either,3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I can sum this up in one word.... AWFUL. Dwayne Johnson was the only saving grace for this movie, as at least with him you know what to expect and he has charisma to carry it off. Jason Statham and Idris Elba however were terrible. Statham seems to feel that he needs to play this cockney barrow boy character, yet the man is from Derbyshire!! His performance is extremely wooden, and is matched by Elba. Idris has been touted for the next James Bond, yet he keeps doing action movies that demonstrate exactly why he would be useless in that role....... first there was Bastille Day and now this. He is great when playing a sultry street wise cop, as with Stringer Bell and Luther, but action ....its not you mate. Add these performances to some terrible dialogue it makes this movie really one to miss.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"The film follows the mantra of ""not being too serious"" which means joking, high-fiving and being fake.

This is 2019. Stathom knows real tough guys ""act nice"", but Johnson is still ""acting tough"" the whole way through which comes across fake... as do all the other supposed tough characters.

At one point in the movie there is a samoan war dance. This is one of the greatest things for realism you can add to a movie, but here they used the first and last three seconds, and softened the impact of the end. In the fight scene afterwards, it is acted with realism, but they used shakey cam and cliche panic music over the top (typically used to cover bad acting), so you couldn't see the good acting...",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Felt bad for jason and idris

They deserve more than that",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"It's such a disconnect from the Fast & Furious franchise that we are used to, they should have just left that part off of the title. We have all come to accept some level of cheese going through the F&F series but this one is off the charts. I found myself laughing throughout all of the rising action scenes. Maybe I'm just a huge fan of the early entries in the series and am still upset about the loss of Paul Walker but honestly, it feels like they are just trying way too hard. And with the director being a stuntman, you can definitely tell it's like he is setting up the scenes to check things off of his stuntman checklist. With all of that out of the way, lets talk about what this series is all about - cars. They have completely lost their way on this aspect because there were only 2 cool rides in the whole film and they were the offroad unnamed thing and the dropped Peterbuilt. Remember the first couple of F&F movies? I can call out all of the cars because that's what this series is about. I remember leaving the theater in a cloud of smoke! Not this one though. It's more of a failed James Bond + Jason Bourne + The Transporter. I think it's time to stop and let Paul Walker rest in piece and quit trying to make easy dollars off of this franchise. Let's leave it where it can be viewed and respected rather than run it into the ground like this trash flick is trying to do.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Too many exaggeration!! Watched only 25minutes of the movie and got fed up! Its more like the Matrix rather then Fast and furious!,3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Entertaining, but it's just another one. It's like a template. Very commercial. The first movies were nice, but now they're just more of the same.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Ok. So if you like montages between almost every scene and two guys trying to out alpha each other with corny one-liners then this could be your bag. Me, I was bored. The film went for far too long and had no substance. Some of the scenes could've been improved by not turning them into an MTV music video for kids. But some parts were entertaining enough to get me through to the end.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Dwayne Johnson has some great movies. I believe he may very well be the greatest action star of today, and I am always on the lookout for his films. This one, however, disappoints.

Hobbs and Shaw tries to be cool. It tries to be grounded. It tries to relate to you. But it just doesn't.

The Fast and Furious movies were about cool dudes riding fast cars, and usually showcases their rebellious, street racing lives. This movie shows the other side of that drama, from the police perspective.

If you are into cop action movies, then go for it. I couldn't watch it all the way through.

3 stars",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"It's incredible what get's the green light in Hollywood. Simple and stupid plot, no sensible coherence in the ""funny scenes"", the use of Kevin Hart and Ryan Reynolds feels unnecessary and just an excuse for having them in the movie + it doesn't add anything and feels so unfulfilling like the rest of the movie. It's not a Fast and Furious film (which no one of the others films since the third should be called). They are way over the top and has moved so far away from the original as humanly possible. Looking forward to see Dwayne Johnson in a good movie in the future and not just a crowd pleaser as the last 5-6 movies of his has been.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Fast and Furious is a saga that has been acclaimed by people, but I really do not like it, it is a silly saga without meaning, it can be said that it is macho, but I recognize that this is trying to give you the message of the importance of the family; Fast and Furious (2001) is not a bad movie, but it is not good, it is only mediocre, it does not have much to say, it is just one more movie in the Hollywood catalog instead its sequel + Fast + Furious (2003) that yes It is a very bad movie and in my opinion it is the worst of the saga, what happens is that it has a story so bad and poorly written that it becomes difficult to see, then it comes Fast and Furious: Challenge in Tokyo (2006) many They consider this the worst of the saga, but for me it honestly does not seem so bad, but again I can not say that it is good, the problem is that technically it is like the one but in Tokyo and without any of the characters previously presented, Quick and Furious (2009) was that movie that began to give the saga a touch of action, the problem is this has a very poor story that ends up being very bad at the technical level therefore a very bad movie, then surprisingly it takes Fast and furious 5incontrol (2011) and this is the truth if I liked it, since unlike the others this is the most visually entertaining, has the best sequences of action and is the one that ""explores"" the theme of the family, Fast and Furious 6 (2013) is a bad movie falls on the typical simplistic plot and as the others becomes heavy to watch, Fast and Furious 7 (2015) I understand that it is for many the best of the saga, but being honest much of its acclaim is only due to the impact of the death of Paul Walker (who died because it was raised in his head that he was also Fast and Furious) I can say that this is a step above the mediocre and I recognize that it has a good ending, in fact they could have closed and to finish this saga with this movie, but they let success and popularity go to their heads and they brought us Fast and Furious 8 (2017) and this one that is bad is a mediocre action movie mixed with a movie of super heroes, and fine It arrives Fast and Furious Presents: Hobs and Shaw (2019) a story of mediocre superheroes, but with the characters of Fast and Furious, in a nutshell the film is about two people who are going to save the world of black Superman. This time Fast and Furious do not bring us the ninth installment that will be later, this time they bring us a spin-off ""What joy, now Fast and Furious will form their cinematic universe."" The reason I review this movie is just because I couldn't see it when it was in theaters, so technically I barely saw it, so let's start, to start the movie is worse than I imagine, but I think it should start to talk about the good first, I can very well notice that the film gives its touch of importance to the family at the end and that some of the action sequences are something creative to tell the truth, outside of that I have nothing to say a favor of the movie. The plot is lazy repetitive and predictable, a man wants to destroy the world for us to evolve and professional agencies call Hobs and Shaw because there is no one better apparently making the CIA ridiculous, funny the fact that this movie makes the CIA as an Agency full of useless cowardly debut good for nothing, when we are honest in real life several CIA agents could break Dwayne Johnson's face and Jason Statham without any problem, finally he has to stop him and that's it, no He has nothing more to say, speaking of La Roca and Statham their performances are passable but I don't blame them at all, I say it's not like they are very good actors, I think they should use some of their money in taking acting classes instead of waste it on lawyers who defend in case someone hurts their feelings. The rivalry between Hobs and Shaw is so childish, I understand that perhaps the writers were trying to make a rivalry between the two to make the characters more realistic and more interesting, but this fails and instead of seeing two men who do not get along Well, I see two little girls fighting for which one is the prettiest, because that's what they end up achieving, the plot of the movie stops several times because these two ""alpha males"" stop to analyze to see which one is cooler. Even the action is not good, it is slow and silly that ends up boring, example ""A few soldiers are targeting the black Superman and he begins to attack them and instead start shooting all of them fleeing to kill him they see him and decide to shoot when this one already has them almost lying on the ground "", and I think they abused the CGI a lot, you can notice it with the naked eye every time they use it, and more is more of the same, as always classic of these films there are many scenes that they contradict the laws of physics, in other words that are the opposite of real life. The movie apart is something macho, it makes Hobs and Shaw shine and sexualizes something for women, and women here have no time to shine, but hey, everyone loves this movie, men and women. And finally, I just want to mention that the film is very bad at the technical level, it is badly made, it does not have a color palette or anything like that, the soundtrack is not very good, they only play popular songs that they thought were going to sound cool and that's it, but hey it's not like David Leitch is a great director, the only good thing he's done is John Wick. In conclusion, Hobs and Shaw is a 135-minute film, but that feels much longer, terrible on a technical level, visually boring, abuse of CGI, ridiculous action sequences, the comedy he has is silly, his dialogue is silly, his Villain is ridiculous for the simple fact that the bad guy says to himself when, if we compare it with the real evils of real life, he would stay in diapers, and that is why this film deserves no more than a 3/10, one of the worst movies of the year, beware that 9 and 10 are coming.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Hobbs and Show is a meeting of enemies after many years, cinematography accustomed us to a happy end, this film led to a happy end, which was on one side of the plate and on the other hand to some extent real. The director decided to go with a lot of special effects, so the plot is not on a particularly high level, and I would say weak. The photos are taken in a good way and the shots from the Hobbs family pages are really pleasing to the eye, the music is modern and quite pleasant and suited to the film. The acting in this film is differentiated between the good roles of Statham and Johnson, wandering through some good roles and ending with the great disappointment of Idris Elb's play.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw it's a different franchise. This is a popcorn movie. Sometimes you just wanna kick back, have some laughs and watch dudes get punched in the face. They can't all be Oscar winners. this movie was really bad, it was immensely boring, the rock didn't even seem like the same character from fast and furious, wheres the beard, wheres his hard attitude? this movie has 0 relation to fast and furious, just a couple names, that's it, its complete trash, are we gonna ignore the fact that the dialogue could have been written by a 9 year old and the fighting choreography was basic compared to the prison fight from fast 8. Idk i don't wanna be a hater but cmon this was so childish its sad. This movie is just so boring and so disappointing! ""Pure trash!""... Without any doubt was a total waste of time and money! ""Ridiculous!"" Not even having the presence of Jason Statham, Helen Mirren, Ryan Reynolds and all the possible and imaginable special effects was not enough to save this damn movie! Anyway Dwayne Johnson's performance was horrible! This movie should go back to the depths of hell where it belongs! Did you notice how fast the weather was changing in the last scenes?!! it suddenly turns into a sunny day, was so strange!!",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"This movie was terrible. The ""humor"" was absent and misused, seemed strained AT most. NO one in The movie teater laughed except for The cameos. The script seemed loosely ripped of from MI:2 and Im sorry but just wasnt working. Props to Idris for his take on The villan and ofc there was some cool action.

Over all resumé. Just stop The series",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"By far the worst movie in the F&F series.... (yes.. even worse then Tokyo Drift) Has nothing to do with with Fast&Furious anymore!! Bad, computer rendered, total B.S. action scenes...with ''transformer'' bikes and cars that drive and go around a corner like in a really bad video game...

Please stop this B.S.!! Stop the staining of the ''legacy'' that Paul (and all the others) left us!",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"It's certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen, but as high-octane action movies go, it is very underwhelming and mediocre. The dialogue is terrible, the plot is an incoherent mess, and it uses all the tropes and cliches you can imagine, completely unironically. Even the combined power Idris Elba, Jason Statham, and The Rock is not enough to save it.

It can be a little entertaining, if you can manage to sufficiently disengage your brain, but there are many better options to spend your time on, including pretty much any other movie any of the three is in.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"So we meet Hobbs and Shaw again, and instead of being the characters in Fast and Furious, we instead get into some weird parallel world, where science fiction runs rampant.

Where Fast and Furious is known for fast moving cars doing some amazing stunt work, Hobbs and Shaw is a world of fisticuffs and science fiction. I realize the producers were trying to capitalize on the F&F franchise, but it was a poor way to go about it.

- - SPOIL ALERT - - -


The one thing we never saw in the F7F series was out of this world science fiction, with Hobbs and Shaw, thats exactly what we saw. From viruses that can wipe out humanity, to people who can open up and reveal mechanized bodies. Robotics is no where near that advanced, so we suddenly have a timeline which jumps 100 years into the future technology wise, but stays the same in cars. This one minor plot flaw completely ruined the movie for me.",3
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"You'd think with these iconic characters that the movie would be funny and overall entertaining. However, at best I laughed 5 times (within the two and a half hour movie!) and found the movie to be never ending. I was going into this movie with an open mind and not a lot of judging, but it's hard to sit back and enjoy a movie that's dull and is longer than it should be. The movie just lacked a lot in the story telling and just bad writing. There were also a lot of scenes that just weren't necessary at all and very unrealistic.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Siamo alle solite, e sprecare parole per questa recensione per me significa fare un grosso sforzo. Ormai agosto è arrivato e ciò significa prodotti scadenti al cinema e un ennesimo nuovo capitolo della saga di ""Fast & Furious"", o meglio, questa volta uno spin-off. Non saprei nemmeno cosa e come cominciare a scrivere: gli standard ormai sono gli stessi di sempre e comportano, accanto ad una buona scelta musicale, forse l'unica cosa passabile dell'intero film, una sceneggiatura misera ed un soggetto che potrebbe, per esser buoni, occupare tre righe di un foglio A4. I personaggi mancano della componente umana e, stereotipati al massimo nel loro ruolo di uomini alpha, perdono quel briciolo di credibilità che li rende reali. Ben lontane sono le basi che aveva gettato il primo film. Questo ideale è stato tradito già da troppo tempo, così come la volontà di creare un prodotto che possa semplicemente intrattenere. Infatti, oltre ad essere estremamente lungo, ""Hobbs & Shaw"" risulta anche incredibilmente noioso, ripetitivo e privo di una struttura portante che possa definirsi avvincente. Accanto a brevi momenti di pausa tra una scena d'azione e l'altra, in cui si prova in modo grottesco a dare un briciolo di umanità ai protagonisti, rimangono soltanto gli elementi che ti fanno apprezzare il cinema: la poltrona, il grande schermo e il proiettore. Per il resto ho già sprecato troppe parole.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"The last throes of summer usually brings more of the empty headed, popcorn filling time fillers as autumn approaches & this film fits nicely in that description & that's not a slam, I usually enjoy them but in this case, being released under the Fast & Furious banner rather hurts the franchise than help it. So we have Idris Elba as the baddie out to secure a deadly virus which will turn any human's innards to jelly but his plans are thwarted when Shaw's sister, played by Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Fallout), absconds w/the item which she injects into her body. Shaw & Hobbs, both already unlikely partners from their previous F & F appearances, have to join forces to save the girl, the virus & stop the self proclaimed Black Superman. Even having Chris Morgan (the scriptwriter of the majority of the series) on board doesn't make things entertaining but rather infuriating at every turn as we interject a high dose of sci-fi gobbledygook which would've worked if we were telling a story which inhabited the world presented but as it is, all the loud noises, flat messages about 'family' & the Rock's workout regiment soon starts to grate rather than appreciate.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Ok.....this is not fun anymore. that formula is getting tiresome and also it was not done right in this film. too many beating and mindless action combined with ridiculous comedy factors plot was just a pretext and this gets nadir. at least previous fast films had also emotions and story and the beating was not 100% of the films like it was in this film. it was like we watched a videogame of beating.

even if u are fast fan...even if u love the main actors who play in this u can skip this one and what for the next fast film which also will be an official sequel to part 8 (this was a spin of) . it should be better than this one.

grade // C -",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,I am Disappointed. I was expecting it to be bad but not that bad. I mean it felt like a very cheap movie.,4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I had check repeatedly if i was mistakenly not watching a new transformers movie or some marvel super hero movie. Too much cgi, over the top unbelievable future tech and super hero nonsense! Wheres the story? It could have been written by a child, and ive noticed most movies these days are like this... The movie industry is ruined by the people who wright the scripts... And also by the people who approve the scripts. I love to know who is rating 10 and 9 on this movie? My 4 rating is already pushing it. These days any movie that looks like a playstation game, gets appraise. Its shocking",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Whilst there's a high amount of action in this film (as you'd expect), the quality is poor and just relies on star power to pull through. As a spin off, you'd expect it to relate to the Fast & Furious franchise on some level but it really doesn't. The storyline is just ridiculous and makes no sense, even trying (poorly) to give Hobbs a love interest that is just cringeworthy all around. They really should have ended the franchise after Paul Walker's death, he wouldn't have wanted this. Dwayne Johnson however, is a master at marketability and can make money out of anything, hence why this film is a success financially.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Not sure whether this was trying to be a comedy or action movie. In both it fails. Not in the least funny. On the other hand tried to pack far too many outrageous stunts into the movie. Some scenes we could really have done without.,4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Three days have passed and I have forgotten. Is this the movie about car races? The same old sauce. Tough speaking, a lot of punching, some racing and unbelievable sequences that 007 may only dream about. Another sequel, another unremarkable storyline. Bad guy wants world to burn. Bad guy bad. Good guys good. The last part is just so ridiculous, and the setting is just the icing on the cake. See you next year for the next installment of Fast and Furious: Whatever.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Just Not enough Fast Cars and Furious Characters for me, a bit of the shiny chrome",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"The title should pretty much explain my impression of the movie. Let it be known, first, that I'm a fan of the F&F franchise and generally admire all 3 of the main male characters. But, overall, this movie was a big disappointment to me. Action:: lots of fight scenes (but never between Hobbes and Shaw), vehicle chase scenes, and explosions.

Blustering: Hobbes and Shaw spend an inordinate amount of time telling each other how badly they are planning on hurting each other. All talk here - no action.

Acting: Only Kevin Hart impressed me. He actually played pretty much the same character he always plays but he stole the show (which wasn't hard to do). Too bad they didn't give him more air time. Ryan Reynolds - eh; not his best work.

Final thoughts - a mostly unmemorable movie. I hope there is not a sequel!",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Scenario is relarively good and acting is at its best. But the actions scenes, which are the big part of the movie were really bad. Almost in every fight scene,there are weapons but no one knows how to shoot or more importantly when to shoot. It feels more like an japaneese anime where they talk before they get in conflict. I mean, they are fighting over a virus that can kill the whole planet and yet, it feels like they are fighting over a bowl of cereal. I was gonna stop watching after about an hour.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Fast & Furious has long been a Call of Duty in the world of cinema. With what in all its bad features. Interesting story, raising important topics, looking at life situations - no, Fast & Furious about another. Here is action every minute, garbage jokes and the slightness of logic (about realism so silent). Fast & Furious for that and watch, in only Hobbs & Shaw it 's spin-off. And he is absolutely grey and not remarkable, in which it is interesting to watch only for Jason Statham.I do not understand why the main antagonist is so faceless if he is played by one of the best British actors Idris Elba.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Fights, chases and not taxing on the brain cells, so bog standard fare for this franchise. It was entertaining, but nothing special. I gave it 4 stars for Idris Elba.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,I'm a huge film fan and I love the F&F franchise from day one. Individually the actors are great - but it's just not a great story. Sometimes the banter is annoying and just felt too staged. I love escapism but this was just dumb. In previous films I could let the stupidity ride because I loved either the cars or the family story or the actors and I didn't really care about the outcome but I just wanted this film to end. It's probably 45 minutes too long. I honestly felt that to carry the Fast and Furious name was a bit of an insult it was so loose as to be non existant. It could have been an unrelated film with different character names and still had the same effect. I felt like the camera work made it feel like a documentary too. But hey it is what it is. It's mindless escapism I just can't help but feel that the two leads think they are bigger than the name - which is a real shame.,4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Average movie predictable, unfunny but the action wasn't that bad but didn't produce a single laugh out of me and there is so much scenes where there's so called comedy but ya dumb people would enjoy it",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"The story is all over the map, the new characters have no real reason of being there. The air marshall story, the CIA guy. As the story goes it is extremely crappy. Especially because when is suppose to attract your attention it starts to fade away. If it werent for the franchise and the leading actors and actress, this script would have gone directly to dvd.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Getting paid for good review? Meh.

What is this? Shawsank Redemption Reborn who deserves 10/10? Meh.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"I just wanna say RIP Paul Walker and RIP Fast & Furious. This was bad! Is a movie action? A comedy? Drama? Dudeeee, whereeee is the cars? WHERE IS THE FAST & THE FURIOUS???? i cant belive! the francise is RAMBO now.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,The main characters are high octane underdogs. this movie has a mediocre plot and the acting is sassy.,4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"Nothing fresh about this movie, just like a copy paste of another franchises.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Fast and the furious? Haha behave! From racing cars to saving the world. I mean what the hell. Yeah this is a good cheesy action film but shouldn't be included in the FF franchise. Please just take fast and furious back to its roots,4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"The Fast franchise has dropped every pretense of self-seriousness and reality (I realize that's a stretch, but they never dealt with man-machine hybrids before) to bring us Hobbs & Shaw. Following the likes of Marvel, they're clearly trying to expand their universe, and wallets, by largely shedding their trademark automobile action to give us an entry only interested in quipping and looking cool, but failing on both. Where John Wick actually does awesome things, these guys just stand around, unconvincingly bragging about being awesome. It's an ego-driven star vehicle is as unoriginal as it is sweaty. The story is simple and bad: two previous Fast villains team-up to save the world. Even the characters within the movie know this is old-hat, so that's not really the problem. The fault lies in its two main interests: action and comedy. The set-pieces are the worst kind of modern laziness, leaning on the crutches of green screen, CGI and rapid editing instead of more impressive and effective practical work. On the comedic side, there's an endless amount of bickering and lame one-liners that are more annoying than funny. For all the charisma of the Rock and the action-star strengths of Statham, cracking-wise isn't their forte. Not that the movie is bereft of all quality. There's a solid hallway fight that balances humor and action decently, and the final battle is audaciously insane fun. A couple of solid comedic cameos come in and handle the tone with aplomb, and Kirby steals the movie whenever she's given the chance. Unfortunately, obnoxious filmmaking and a bad script make this mostly a noisy onslaught of uninteresting clichés with only moments of inspired fun.",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"As always, you know from the start how the movie will end. Come on surprise people ..",4
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"This is one of the worst movies in 2019. So many unreal scenes, i understand its a Dwayne and Jason in this movie but, what?????? What???? Story, story is to bad and you can see from miles what is coming next. And yes, every 4 minutes in this movie some one call someone ellse a brother.... !!!! Wachable but very bad",4
Furious 7,So boring films wrestlers have his movies stink the rock lame Hollywood remakes run out of films I think stupid films,1
Furious 7,Dumb films no meaning the rock films stink no plot awful acting spoilers,1
Furious 7,I don't know if it just me . I can't even get to watch a movie on my phone . All I get is trailer and the watch list doesn't even work.,1
Furious 7,"Huge respect for Paul.In my opinion he was the heart of this movie franchise and a real car enthusiast but my rating is just for the movie. Its bullshit,it is a SF movie not an action movie and because the original one is rated 6,7/10 and this one has rating of 7,7/10 i give 1/10. For me this franchise ends here.I m probably not watching next one. First movie was something special an these which came later just crap. Some were little bit better than other but in comparison with first movie which have some relation to cars and racing these later movies just became action on steroids and finally SF crap movie.

Great ending and that is only what I liked in this movie. RIP Paul.",1
Furious 7,"I will start by paying my respects to Paul Walker i'm really sorry this was his last movie. As for the movie i don't know where to start...It's so bad that i can't even describe it.. I have to say that i enjoyed even over the top fake films like Expendables but this one has set the sci-fi to a whole other level.. The characters from simple drivers are now ninjas with expert combat skills.Undying...i mean 30 punches and a hit in the head with a 3 feet wrench didn't even slow down Vin Diesel.It would take more than an hour of writing to describe every physics defying thing that happened in this hilarious movie.It is so fake that i'm really trying not to hate the characters that i loved until 2 fast 2 furious. This movie targets maybe for children under 12.There's no reasonable human being that will not feel offended by it's stupidity,lack of common sense,fake physics,non existing plot....i could keep going forever but i don't feel like wasting another minute with this movie.Avoid in any cost",1
Furious 7,"I'll keep this nice and quick and simple. This movie is absolutely awful. I get the whole Paul Walker tribute thing but even that isn't enough to make up for the extent of horrible that this movie easily reaches. I got dragged out there to see it with a few friends, expecting it to be at least half decent (considering how hyped up it is) and I was surprised. Not pleasantly, either.

The acting is absolutely atrocious. The story line is cliché and not even the least bit creative or believable for that matter, but I'll get into that in a moment. Corniest thing I've seen. Maybe ever. Not to mention the fact that it is almost 2.5 hours long! I understand a good movie being that long (i.e. Fight Club) but this was just 2.5 hours of complete idiocy. The only half decent thing about the movie is that it does have some pretty beautiful visuals. Other than that, complete trash. The storyline has been done. It tried to be hard and sentimental, but turned out to be cheesy and weak.

I understand a movie being a bit of a fantasy or having fantastical elements, but this just slaughtered any hope I had left for this film. Various completely unrealistic and predictable fight scenes, cars flying off of planes and through buildings (and still, miraculously, surviving the fall), a ton of things that didn't even make any sense (that might just be because I pretty much kept falling asleep), and a bunch of completely pointless car engine revving and head on collisions. This may seem a bit nit-picky, but the thing that really bugged me throughout the whole thing was the fact that no matter how many intense, violent fights happened, not a single scratch could be found on any of the characters. They rolled a car off a cliff at tremendous speed, crashed a train, got smacked around in horrible fist fights and wrecked pretty much every car that they came in contact with in an incredibly destructive way and still, nothing! They just pop out looking perfect and unscathed! I think that's just poor production and a complete lack of attention to detail.

None of the characters were particularly likable, the only one I even really cared for at all was Brian, Paul Walker's character. Everyone else I pretty much disliked equally. I was disappointed because it had a pretty good cast of actors and actresses and I expected something of much better quality. Overall, waste of time. If you really, really love Fast & Furious franchise, give it a go. But this was just atrocious. Not even remotely worth the $10 theater ticket. But I guess that's a different argument altogether.",1
Furious 7,"I was already skeptical on this movie after the utterly disgusting furious 6 but still as I've seen every movie in the series I gave it a try, later on all I found was another disappointing movie by the fast team. Every actor in the movie bored like anything they really need to learn how to act The story and plot were so poor they can't be recovered with fast 8 The action was recursive Moreover Jason felt like a piece of gutter roaming around again actor wasted The worst movie of the year or decade don't know Honestly I was looking for a better tribute to walker but I managed to watch what they showed Walker wasn't a legendary actor to be missed his vacancy won't affect any movie or anyone he was just another guy Let's just walk it off this was the biggest piece of gutter",1
Furious 7,"its a joke wasn't expecting it to be like this cant say much and no way this movie is going to be at the Oscars only Tony Jaa and Jason were good to me but the others they were not good at all to what they did to Paul it was better off wish they could have just canceled this movie I can say this is one of the worst movies from the franchise seconded by Tokyo drift and to talk about the fighting scenes they weren't mixed good and no way Jason would have been beaten by Vin,Jason knows martial arts and I see no reason why he lost that fight and another problem on the first scenes Jason went to the hospital and he fought every there and even some parts of the hospital were bombed and so how was he expecting his brother to survive there that part also it was not worthy it to be in this movie to my point of view fast and furious was the good movie the rest of the 6 movies destroyed the franchise",1
Furious 7,"It would be too hypocritical to say that the Furious 7 might have been more appealing if only the characters were super heroes in full costume and drove extra terrestrial automobiles. Assuming that you can't insist on logic and reasoning if you are a fan of super-hero movies, there should be no reason to not like and enjoy the Fast & Furious franchise.

It wouldn't be untrue to say that the Furious 7 is inspired by the Avengers and the Transformers. But this bunch of non-pretentious super-human beings don't wear super hero suits, and they aren't known by super hero names. They are motor-heads gifted with the skill to mate automobiles with different capabilities and deliver an unassuming hybrid. And their ability to deliver ice cold dialogues with stony expressions is only shadowed by their gut blasting humor.

I wish I'd left the cinema with a t-shirt wet from my drool, watching all the jaw dropping action sequences. But instead I was left with fingers sticky from eating the chokingly sweet caramel popcorn.

Despite being #1 on the IMDb list and scoring over 80% on the Tomatometer, the Furious 7 makes it to the top of my list of 'Super Bad Movies'.",1
Furious 7,"First of all if you're going to watch the movie in a cinema, try to get something to protect your ears! All you see throughout the movie are explosions. The movie does not really seem to have a script, it's all ""let's take our guns and go""! The movie was so ridiculous that everyone was just laughing all the time. And seriously, I had never seen a movie where the main characters were so surprisingly invincible! The guy's car gets crashed, they take him out without an scratch, and try to resuscitate, then suddenly the other female character says stop, and she telling the guy a story brings him back to life! I have two words for this movie, STUPID and LOUD!",1
Furious 7,"Never have I seen a single movie of this series and was encouraged by many that this was a great ""action"" flick. We don't even need to discuss the unrealistic action scenes, but the acting was atrocious. How do these people become movie stars? I have seen better acting in video games. The writing was beyond hideous. Atrocious, atrocious movie. Anyone with half a brain cell wouldn't like this film. I can honestly say that I have never seen a film that makes you feel that your IQ goes down every minute you watch this film. This is the type of garbage that is produced that makes me feel embarrassed that it was created in the United States. The dialog in this film is probably at the third grade level and someone of normal Intelligence could have written the story in about 2 hours.",1
Furious 7,"I greatly enjoyed the first Fast and The Furious movie; it was about the illegals and illegal drag racing, which us kids were involved in back in 2001. It was about the hooked up cars and modifications. Since Fast and Furious became a franchise, I've been disinterested in seeing any its sequels; they just lack substance, and a real story to get into.

Fast and Furious 7 had too many impossible scenes, almost a comic style reality where anything is possible. Flying cars? No problem, it was just horrible. I wanted to leave, I saw a few people leaving the theater, at one point I closed my eyes to sleep.

Honestly I don't even know what the movie was about, other than that 80% of the time, was shooting, things blowing up, racing, crashing, and so on. It just sucked!",1
Furious 7,"I'm giving it a 1, because of all the fans that voted it so high because of Paul Walkers death.

The Fast & Furious franchise is no longer about cars. They started with racing, in the first 3 movies. It doesn't really feel like the F&F franchise anymore without the racing and drifting.. Now its overly exaggerated stunts and action frequencies that will make you laugh... Cheesy lines that will make you cringe..

People shouldn't rate this movie for it's tribute to Paul Walker... you should rate the movie, for what it is.. And at the end of the day its just an okay movie..",1
Furious 7,"Over the years I've, somehow, found a fondness towards the fast & furious line and all things were going relatively well up until now. I can handle the 'cheese' and the cliché verging on preposterous story lines. However, this time it has just fallen to pieces. The acting in this film will make you believe you are watching a school play, the actions scenes so outlandish that you'll be expecting a sound over with audience cheers and laughs. It has a storyline which is literally pointless and ridiculous, think 8 year old boy having a dream that doesn't actually make sense. I've already contacted a hypnotist in the hope that they can wipe my mind so i believe this film never existed and I hope somehow my intelligence will be restored. You will find yourself either walking out, switching off or fighting through it shouting ""what a load of nonsense"" and hating yourself. You have been warned.",1
Furious 7,"one of the worst movie i have ever seen. i wanted to stand up and leave from the start, if you want to make an action movie make an action movie don't make in ridiculously unreal unbelievable and not enjoyable. not recommended if you are older than 5 and don't get exacted from unrealistic ridiculously movies. why does every member of the group can fight and shot and drive like an expert? a car that drove through three buildings? please register for the next winter semester in any college to study physics 101 dudes. with all do respect for Paul walker, this movie was bad and i'm sad for him that this was his last one. glad that this movies series is over!",1
Furious 7,"OMG! I can't believe this is a popular movie. It is stupid beyond belief. I lasted a very painful hour before totally giving up on it. These idiots would have died a thousand times during that hour, yet (unfortunately) they're all still walking around.

I remember seeing the first one. Didn't Paul Walker play a cop trying to infiltrate this gang of criminal street racers? And now they're all some elite crew of government agents with an unlimited budget. ""Over- the-top"" doesn't even begin to describe this. I don't even think there's a plot. (Although it's possible that my mind was wandering so much due to a complete lack of stimulation that I missed it.) What a joke.",1
Furious 7,"I am in short, a movie fanatic. I've seen thousands of titles and continue to download, watch and go see pretty much everything that sees the light of day ( apart from horror, that stuff just doesn't get me going )

Obviously I know that this film wasn't intended to be a serious, deep or reality-driven flick. That being said, they took the entire premise of this series ( Cars, and their drivers ) and they destroyed it. This film is nothing but a lengthy sequence of ridiculous action scenes. There isn't a word or single action in this movie that could be credited as plausible.

Every time I thought they'd gone and done the most absolutely improbable action I conceived possible, they topped it the next minute. THROUGHOUT 2 HOURS. Don't expect any character development or meaningful moments because it's one-liners glued together by plain absurdity.

People revering it because it was Paul Walkers last project is the sole reason this film stands at an astonishingly undeserving 7.8.

The only reason I finished it was because I was watching with friends and couldn't really turn it off at two thirds of the film. This was easily the worst film I've seen in the past decade and I saw the likes of Cloud 9, and every piece of crap Steve Austin and Seagal throw at me.

I was looking forward to a fun, decently acted ('cause come on), well shot, driver / car oriented action movie and was sorely disappointed.",1
Furious 7,"The franchise as a whole is puerile, low-budget comic-strip quality narrative. It offends the normal feelings of family, hypes machismo, degrades women, and makes Transporter narratives look coherent. If these actors were giant robots, Transformers would still be better.

I was roped into seeing this one only on a bet - we all lost, as the movie was voted as less than a 5 out of 10 by all who attended. I'm sorry my ticket purchase will contribute to a future installment of a seriously bankrupt spittle of movie making.

Even the actors looked as if they were dialing in their performances for the sake of one of their co-stars. I believe their sentiments were genuine, but their portrayals felt as feigned as their over-used lines.",1
Furious 7,"So many people liked this movie but is it because the movie is good or because one of the actors died? People who did even know the name of Walker were so sad because of his dead that they suddenly realized they were his biggest fans. Apparently his tragic dead made him also a better actor.

Well... I am a person who looks objectively on things and I have to tell you I just could't wait until the end, I had to leave. But then again as 99.99% of the American movies the end is always obvious, the good guys defeat the bad. The end. I didn't really need to watch the end.

Why was it so bad? The reason is, it is absurd. From the first scene we see one guy who managed to almost destroy a hospital. SUVs crashed into the building, SWAT teams all dead and our guy visiting his brother and threatening the doctors. Walks out and finds his car parked right in front of the entrance while everything else is destroyed... and in all that time the police is nowhere to be found.

In the Fast and Furious universe you can jump with your car from a plane and land on a very specific location without any navigation what so ever. You can also crash your car dawn a mountain hill and not only be alive but also without a scratch. In addition, you can have a device that can access all cameras and mics in the world simultaneously and find anybody but when the special ops teams go to apprehend that someone, they would not use any surveillance and go blindly so that they can be superseded that there is an entire army waiting for them there. The US government does not use satellite images and infrared to asses the situation...that's just for losers. On top of everything military helicopters and military drones owned by private individuals can fly freely over American cities and fire missiles on whatever they want without being detected and obviously without being interrupted by any government agency. Why? Very simple. Our good guys have to defeat the bad guys by themselves. Otherwise it will not be that ""dramatic"" and the victory wont be theirs.

As usual for the Fast and Furious, the acting was mediocre and when it comes to plot...well there isn't any. As long as there are nice cars and they show you an ass or two it OK. That is all you need.",1
Furious 7,"Zero plot, highly unrealistic stunts , lame and repetitive things.

Only the first fast and furious was good because it was about CARS and Racing. Not war.

The guy beat an entire team of trained special forces , however a bald guy with steroid muscles manages to beat him.

Jason Statham is such a awesome actor and yet i feel he could not figure out the plot of this ridiculous childs story.

Also, its interesting how we all feel for the bunch of criminals and thief's who race cars and destroy everything and not give a dam about anything else. And the government seeks their help to do their job. Such a perfect world scenario where the crooks win and live,drive luxurious cars and enjoy beautiful woman.

I like how they used Paul's death to make even more money.",1
Furious 7,A movie with vin diesel will never be a good movie. It's just not possible.,1
Furious 7,"I was hoping to watch an action movie that some scene that make sense somehow but what i saw was really disappointing. i would give zero as vote for this movie and regret how i spent my Saturday night for this nonsense movie. i feel like an idiot that waste my time and saw this piece of sh... full of nonsense actions. retard-ed director.

Vin Diesel should work on his body it was so obvious that he has a big fat belly. i expected that director could consider some respect for the people watching this sh-t but it seems people in this movie living in another world with different physic rules , don't waste your time to watch this",1
Furious 7,"OK the same story but too stretched, ded franchise.",1
Furious 7,The movie should have ended at the abandon mill. Why mover to the city where unnecessary blood needs to be spills. Just to save a british agent they run like losses The hero team is nothing but just a bunch of losses from start to end. If I am the ghost I first kill all the enemies family members right down to there pet poodle. Just to made them go crazy a crazy man can't think straight than you go for from the bottom up. That way that poor sad hero of this movie stand chance again the ghost which just one man. I waited 7 years to watch this. Is no wonder and still cannot believe how I suffer throughout this movie. Is time to put in a all new cast. Lose these bunch of losses.,1
Furious 7,"Iv'e seen A lot of movies in my life but there's some things out there that people need to know about, at first i was kind of interested because Tokyo drift was good because Paul Walker was not in it Paul Walker reminds me of when your walking down the street and you step in a pile of dog s#%t they need to get ropes and other things to make him apart of the walking dead cause he is actually dead great realism, there's a American dad episode about the fast and the furious its probably the most accurate depiction of the movies series iv seen, its sad that we have to related to low brow trash like animated series like American dad but this is where we are.",1
Furious 7,"Some movies are bad in interesting ways (""Olympus Has Fallen"" and the original ""Independence Day"" come to mind). But ""Furious7"" is a badly written story with a script that shouldn't keep a middle-schooler interested. Nothing makes sense: The main villain appears by magic, entire armed squads appear by magic, helicopters and armed drones appear by magic. The plot disappears by magic.

""Furious7"" is a series of action sequences, allegedly spectacular stunts and special effects separated by...I'm not sure what to call the non-action sequences: Narrative? No, because there is no coherent story told. Exposition? Nope, nothing is set-up or explained. Boring? Pointless? Amateurish? YES! That's it! Amateurish writing. Bring on a script doctor...and pronounce this ""Mission Impossible"" rip-off DOA.

Less than half way through ""Furious Seven"" I was entertaining myself by making mental notes about the illogical, nonsensical, and often irrational elements (dropping cars from an airplane and having them parachute directly onto a roadway!?!?) that are meant to pass as story. BTW---why air-drop the cars onto the roadway? Why not use the same magical device Jason Statham (as Deckard Shaw) used to get to the same site? Or just DRIVE there.

Other fun WTF's: Why did Shaw destroy the hospital on his way to visiting his injured brother? Why does anyone in the Furious gang trust each other since they are constantly keeping secrets about and from each other? Dwayne Johnson (as Hobbs) has a broken collar bone and a fractured arm (which is encased in a cast) but at a critical point in the movie he removes the cast by...wait for it...flexing his bicep and BURSTING the plaster. Never mind the miraculous healing of broken bones which has occurred in such a short period of time that no muscle atrophy has happened, he burst a cast by FLEXING HIS BICEP. I have a mental image of a doctor and several nurses following him out of the hospital yelling ""Your medical record will indicate you left against medical advice!"" The list of such nonsense is as long as the script, so if you get trapped into watching ""F7"" (hey--the F7 key on many computers opens the spell check or thesaurus apps---that's kind of on-the-nose) perhaps you will find some pleasure in finding more plot black-holes.

I rate ""Furious7"" a 2. I'd give it a 1, but there was ONE good line of dialogue:

Letty (to Dom): ""Why didn't you tell me we were married?""

Dom: ""You can't TELL someone they love you.""

Seriously, that's the high point of the script for a very low movie.

I saw ""Furious7"" on a BluRay (it didn't make it any better) I borrowed from the library. Had I paid to see the movie I might have asked my bank to decline payment on the debit card charge.

RIP Paul Walker. At least YOU looked good in the epilogue.",2
Furious 7,"This film is absolutely awful. No amount of stunts, explosions, car crashes and shootouts hide the fact that the plot makes absolutely no sense. The fast and the furious started out as a semi believable film about Street racing. Seven films in and the only way you could explain the time line between those two films is if it turns out Dominic hit his head at the end of the first film and we're experiencing his wild coma induced fever dreams. It's honestly sad Paul walker died whilst production of this film was wrapping up but don't let the fans of the series inflated review scores talk you into watching this film. Do yourself a favour, watch the first one and pretend there aren't any sequels.",2
Furious 7,"I call it profit pandering when all that the producers ask of the writer and director is to make sure there are as many formula scenes (movie history has proved these to be money makers) as possible to attract the widest audience. Check out the proof: 1. Prolonged close up shots of the rear ends (said this way to bypass Amazon censors) of bikini, barely clad, humans. Check! 2. Prolonged close up shots of the males who compensate for their small appendage (said this way to bypass Amazon censors) by over pumping (exaggerating) the male antlers (i.e. muscle). A skill acquired first by practice posturing in front of their full length mirrors. Males further enhance their displays by seeming to always be wearing tight tees (if at all) with small sleeves to promote those antlers. So much non- functional muscle that if they tried running they might outrun a sloth. Check! 3. Furthering this theme is the storyline of ""muscle"" cars accompanied by prolonged close ups of ""pushing the pedal to the metal"" and massaging the manual shift with the that standard coup de grâce - squealing tires. Oh, and the car drop from airplane - done before. Check! 4. Assault on bad guy fortress - done so many times in film it has actually become boring. Fight scenes - an Oscar for camera angles. Bruce Lee, if he could see this, would be laughing in his Lake View home. Check! 5. Dialogue? Written for that part of the audience that struggled to pass sophomore English in high school. Check! 6. Inject into the storyline the latest pop news headlines caption grabber - terrorists and hackers. Check!",2
Furious 7,"A movie seemingly written by a ten year old boy. Everyone plays one dimensional characters that exist solely to drive the cars. I think Tony Jaa got paid more to appear as a nameless villain in this movie than he ever got for any of the Ong Bak movies. Jason Statham plays an evil version of his Transporter character, specifically because the Transporter character drove cars, like that's why he's in this movie cause the ten year old who wrote this movie was like ""who's the toughest car driver to fight the car drivers of Fast and Furious? Oh yeah J. Statham!"" It's a stupid car chase movie, there is zero plot zero creativity zero cool, it made a fortune.",2
Furious 7,"I am not a great fan of fast and furious series.I have actually watched only 2 movies of the series, and I find it completely non- sense. The movie has so,so,so many flaws! Either the director deliberately ignored them, or he is a complete idiot( or he thinks that the audience has no common sense at all) I will leave the technical mistakes for the time being. Focusing on the loopholes of the story.

1) Wherever you go Deckard Shaw follows,Why need God's eye?

2)Dominic and Co. enter the secured terrorist area by jumping from a plane by using their cars(okay I will broaden my mind and assume that this is even possible),but then, an idea crops in your mind,How did Deckard shaw get in there?

3) A drone is called in to kill some random people! This is unbearable!! IF you want to kill some random people on American soil, you do not use a drone! You do it by sending an assassin .Use a sniper rifle and kill them all! Kill them in their sleep! Why use a goddamn drone? And first of all you cannot enter a drone inside USA without the drone being destroyed by the US patrols.

4)There are many such flaws.But these 3 are enough to make the movie dumb.

And one more thing, the genre of the movie should be changed,it should be science fiction.Yes! science fiction, Dominic and his crew are invincible, whatever they do,not a single scratch on them.

The movie is downright stupid and dumb.And one more thing! they are cashing on Paul walkers death! They have announced fast 8 .Its horrible so horrible .",2
Furious 7,"After Fast 5 came out, I thought it wasn't possible to make a more terrible movie, but then they made fast 6. Now they've out done themselves once more. This movie is dreadful. There is not a single racing scene (unless you count the race wars drag), every action scene is extremely unrealistic, and overall the film is simply a failed amalgamation of every possible action movie scene. The first few films worked because of the street racing and the culture. The acting has always been bad, but no one really cared. Cutting the racing scenes along with trying to turn the franchise into a series of heist movies is really what soured the Fast and the Furious for me and really any one who likes good movies. Adding D. Johnson and J. Statham was simply the icing on the cake. Don't waste your time with this movie. The potentially best part of the movie was when Dom meets Sean in Tokyo, but the drifting scene through the parking garage is not shown. The only positive of the movie is the sound track.",2
Furious 7,"This is a ridiculous film from start to finish, I can only imagine the high reviews are sentimental. The story line is terrible, weak and full of holes. It jumps all over, not flowing well at any point. The acting is also terrible, with maybe the exception of Kurt. Jason Stratham plays the same character as he plays in all his films, very poor as usual. However it is the over the top stunts and fight scenes which really ruin the film, truly beyond reality. How the film industry keep getting away with these high budget rubbish films is beyond me, and the actors should have a bit of dignity instead of a big bank balance. I hope they don't scrape the barrel with another sequel!",2
Furious 7,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** When I first started to view the movie, I thought that may be this time, they could have done something good, although I didn't have to wait much time to check that this movie wouldn't be that. From top to bottom by this movie we can assure that Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Vin Diesel are entirely made out of steel, since all of them fight take and gave some punches and kicks, on body and on the face, but the two only things that happened was a broken arm on Dwayne Johnson and a scratch on Vin Diesel face, after being beaten on the face by a steel stick!!! That's impressive and ridiculous. Not only that was really bad, they compile a whole bunch of stupidity and nonsense, I think that my ""favorites"" are by the end, first when the building collapses by the space where Statham is and the following scene where Vin Diesel can put the bag of grenades on the helicopter....Reminded me of an also nonsense scene of Transporter...Probably the presence of Jason Statham inspired that also horrible scene. In conclusion is a bad movie, with an awful story, really bad directed...A bad cinematic experience.",2
Furious 7,"I never expect a lot about fast & furious movies but this one is really poor. The storyline is flat. And It's far far beyond physics... Oh my god, please end this crap !

This is always the same thing during the whole movie... and it is so boring !

Action ? OK, that is all there is in this film with a lot of special FX... this is not how film works.

And about the cars... I guess I will never get used to all those incoherences. Even if I try really hard, you should a least respect the BASICS of mechanical engineering.",2
Furious 7,"This is yet another crappy FaF film filled with unrealistic stunts and American patriotism. Corny dialog, terrible story and terrible characters. I can't see how anyone in there right mind can enjoy this utter tat. All it is, is explosions, woah, butts, yeah, 'Murica, F*** YEAH yet somehow it still receives 7.7 on IMDb. When I went to see i sat down ready to see a bad film but the level of stupidity in this film, there is a scene where Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson rips a mini-gun off an attack helicopter and then carries it around and uses it by hand, and this is after he had his arm broke. Speaking of his broken arm, he sees some action on the news in the hospital stands up out of bed and bends his arm to make the cast break of he then proceeds to use the mini-gun. I mean for god's sake that's not possible. There is also no laws of physics in the Furious universe so don't expect any realism. No one important dies in the film and at the end there is a tribute to Paul Walker which sadly did not last long enough to bring any real emotion, it's about 1 minute of Vin Diesel having flash backs.",2
Furious 7,"Once a simple race car drivers have become a team of superheroes, each of which owns a karate skills hacker and billionaire. Michelle Rodriguez, of course, a strong woman, but watch as she wins Gina Carano and Ronda Rousey, without laughter is impossible. Tony Jaa also appeared jumpy dummy without any achievements. Only Joe Taslim pleased in the sixth series, wiping the floor in the subway a couple of stupid morons. Actors do not play, and all go with a straight face, sometimes showing a light anger. There is no drama. Here there is no one to empathize with, no one to worry about. The characters are so boring and flat, that their cars look much livelier. Big-set of tricks and special effects, stupid and illogical, like all such movies. People eating.",2
Furious 7,"I found myself rooting for the bad guys to just kill all the good guys.

This thing dragged on for hours and was just horrible.

There were a few cool action sequences no doubt, but that is all you are paying for.

All the characters are just not human, I mean how many times can your car drive off a mountain and you just walk away with no injuries lol. How many times can you just jump out of speeding cars and not crack a nail..I know its a movie but come on...

How about having an insane chase, driving to the middle of nowhere and then all of a sudden swarms of swat teams just appear out of nowhere to save the day ( just in the nick of time)! Just so dumb I could not handle it.

The tribute to Paul walker was the best part about the whole movie, and that comes at the very end...",2
Furious 7,"This film has got to be one of the worst that I have ever seen. Apart from the tribute to Paul Walker the whole movie is absolute garbage. The action is completely unrealistic and I found myself laughing at its stupidity. James Wans' favorite way of showing us women appears to be showing us what is going on below the waistline. Everything about the film is cringe worthy, especially the dreadfully written script. There are so many clichés and cheesy one liners in this film that you end up annoyed. Vin Diesel's acting is unrealistic and laughable. The movie is far too long and appears to heavily rely on unrealistic action. Plus - Tribute to Paul Walker Minus - Everything else",2
Furious 7,"From start to finish this movie does it's best to be cool but misses it's mark time and time and time again. Preposterous plot lines and awful action scenes make this celluloid drivel a yawn-fest! Aimed at teenage girls who miss the point and soppy- eyed teens who fancy Paul Whattsisname , it relies on slow motion action sequences that obviously make it easier to take in ! I gave this a 2 because in fairness a whole lotta people worked their butts off to bring this off! I'm gonna keep this review for ""Fast and furious 8"" because its going to be exactly the same as this and the last 6! Forgive and forget says the bible,,,ill forget but i really cannot forgive!! Awful in the extreme!",2
Furious 7,"The biggest problem with this movie is that any plot in there was written around the crazy car stunt ideas they had.

Jumping with the car between skyscrapers? Awesome.

Moving between cars while spinning at high speeds? Cool.

How about parachuting with the cars? realistic? of course not. It's not even original (there was a car ad that did the same stunt).

These stunts are crazy and fun (so what if none of it is realistic).

I just wish they could create a plot that makes sense around it.

They got the brother seeking revenge as the main bad guy. In Die Hard with a Vengeance that idea worked great to justify McClane's involvement (because really, how does that s#$@ keeps happening to him?).

The problem with that plot is that there's not enough there to justify two hours of crazy stunts. So a secondary plot is introduced. The team has to rescue a hacker and find a device that would help them track down the revenge seeking brother.

That would have worked, if that bad guy didn't show up at every location. He shows up every single time and instead of trying to get him they try to escape.

This movie makes no sense but the stunts are fun. Just ignore the dialog and any attempts at a plot and maybe you can enjoy it.

This movie made a lot of money so another is probably on the way. Hopefully they'll use some of that money to hire a real screenwriter",2
Furious 7,"This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Unless you are a 13 year old boy, or have the mind of a 13 year old boy, you should avoid this movie. The script is absolutely horrible, the acting is bad, and the plot is designed for the sole purpose of adding more explosions, unrealistic car chase/jumping scenes, and random scenes of girls in bikinis. Suspension of disbelief? More like expulsion of disbelief. I've never seen anything so cheesy. The lines sound like they were stolen from a video game script. The movie panders to teenage boys who have not learned the general rules of physics or had the opportunity to appreciate the shape of a woman. It should appeal to no one else.

I watched this movie with friends at my apartment and half of them walked out to another room because they couldn't stand to finish it. I finished it simply because I usually trust the reviews on IMDb and thought it might get better. I was wrong. The movie is nonsensical. Don't waste your time or money. The only decent part of the movie is the tribute to Paul Walker at the very end, but I'm sure you could see that on YouTube or just skip to the end of the movie to see it if you feel the need. This movie is way overrated on IMDb. Go watch Interstellar, The Martian, or Inception for a third, fourth, or fifth time instead. They are more realistic anyways.",2
Furious 7,"This movie was simply ridiculous, i mean the PW tribute at the end was very nice and heartwarming but this movie.....

The main characters suddenly were given the decision-making skills of a four year old to enable for the director to put as much of demolition, racing and explosions in this movie as possible. I've always enjoyed the F&F movies but this one was just too ridiculous, stunts went from highly unlikely to straight out impossible in combination with the fact that a team of 10 soldiers suddenly can't hit one single guy standing out in the open with automatic rifles and later in the movie when it IS convenient someone shoots a f*cking hand grenade over a distance of more than 200 meter with a f*cking handgun not to mention how that f*cking thing got there in the fist place!!

But sure don't believe me, go see for yourself and end up in a mental hospital, like me.",2
Furious 7,"The most recent production of the Fast and the Furious franchise does not bring anything new compared to its predecessors. The moments of action are equally interesting, intense, furious and fast as in other movies. And so are the characters. As for the story, it doesn't really matter in this film. Seems like it would be there just to provide a decent separation of Paul Walker. And it manages to do so. He gets exactly what he deserves. The Director uses some interesting techniques. It is obvious that he has been inspired by the many successful films of the genre action-thriller for the production of this film and he tries to emulate them in a discreet manner. There are some memorable moments in this film. For example I will never forget the skydiving cars. But there are some moments that are not plausible at all, for example, a man who has no scratches after he falls with his car in a gap of at least 500 meters. And this is not the only scene full of mistakes. There are many similar moments that make the film look as if it had a budget of $ 1 million, instead of $ 250 million. It is easily seen that the Furious 7 is directed by an amateur. Too much money from the budget have been allocated to the actors and too few for the filmmaker. In conclusion, this film successfully manages to bring quality action to the big screen, but overall it is a mediocre film that does nothing original to the film industry.",2
Furious 7,"I'll say it straight out: I HATED this film! From the huge amount of improbabilities, credibility issues, way too much CGI, questionable action sequences and stupid plot (what was the film about again??), I hate this film with a passion.

I have a lot of respect for director James Wan, but - sorry to say - 'Furious 7' is by far the worst entry in the series - yes, even worse than 'Fast and the Furious 2'. The opening scene already warned me nothing here was going to make sense, and everything was going to be overblown for effect only - to the point of becoming preposterous. In fact, it was...

Jason Statham stars as Deckard Shaw (brother of Shaw from F6, played by Luke Evans). Deckard is an annoying, over-cool character. And Statham is just being Statham again. (I'm beginning to think this guy can't really act and I'm having difficulty telling his films apart, as he always has the same damn character traits. Get a new agent!!).

'Furious 7' now plays like a superhero movie. If the series was intended to be fantastical with superheroes, I'd have accepted this, but the series started out with ordinary characters and everyday events. Absolutely everything here happens on cue, and there are way too many coincidences, conveniences, and close calls. Tyrese Gibson once again serves as comic relief, but this time around way more distracting and annoying than funny (not that he ever was!). It ruins every inch of suspense there might have been.

There are also way too many characters here, and too many different teams. Eventually the film becomes so confusing that I later didn't care anymore what side the characters were on and who was pursuing who. Oh, and when did our heroes become merciless killers? Yup, they're happily shooting people without blinking - like a John Wick movie (I HATE John Wick movies!!).

There are some amazing action sequences, but ultimately it doesn't compensate for the lack of realism, and so CGI-heavy that they're completely forgettable. The scene with the car jumping from building to building was just absurd! With a runtime of around 137 minutes, I found the film at least 30 minutes too long. At times I also forgot about some of the main characters because screen time is divided between way too many characters. I didn't like the film the first time around, and enjoyed it even less the second time. This is a film I want to forget. What was it about again...?? I've already forgotten anyway...",2
Furious 7,"There was nothing new in this movie, same type of old techniques and impossible actions, which are not really possible ways, its kind of funny to me.

Jason Statham was definitely good addition, He done his well & done with his style.

For Paul, We will miss you for the next one, But i think story is end here no more sequence we need on this 'Fast & Furious' or at least change the actors.

I'm not really happy with this move at all :( This is what i feel so far after watching movie.",2
Furious 7,"I liked it when it was about racing, now these criminals are saving the world. Get the hell out here with this b.s. they really need to stop making these garbage movies",2
Furious 7,"I never wrote a review before after watching movies all these years,this one completely disappointed me after seeing the reviews and ratings and how famous the movie was. The movie starts off well and the first 15 minutes good, but after that unrealistic things started happening, Rock falls off from building holding a girl,cars falling from helicopter, driving on cliffs, jumping from cliffs and all that within the first half of movie, wont talk about the second half. Just to mention there's a huge difference in realistic stunts and stunts they showed in furious 7.

Talking about the action and plot of movie, it got worse. A assassin with a lot of skill and special agent from government messing with street drivers while government agencies cant catch him. All of them destroying people property and buildings like 911's happened,with the drone behind their cars and public feels normal and nobody asks nothing except for two police cars that tried to chase them once and wait doing all of that none of the person dies in all this action. Besides the Unrealistic stunts in the movie, there are various technical flaws which made it worse like Rock recovering so soon with broken leg and arm, when leg takes more time to recover specially if its broken in 3, he was running with heavy machine gun in streets by the end of movie and Vin diesel was flying his car to touch the helicopter. I mean Com'on is it a movie or joke as humans cant do this and this wasn't a animated feature film also.

To Make it short, if you have been watching good movies for sometime and know what are stunts and what they did in furious 7, you definitely wont like it as none of it made any sense.",2
Furious 7,"So, the gang is back and going faster and more furious than before! That's basically it!

I don't really know what they were thinking while writing the script but it is really awful and thanks to the circumstances Paul Walker will not be appearing in any of the following furious disasters.

I have seen worse movies but this one is a bad movie with a huge budget and no plot.

Without saying anything bad about the actors, there is something about the movie that just seems really wrong. They just make every stunt performed look way too easy and going in and out of a foreign country is just a breeze. Authorities are absolutely clueless most of the time and just let the good and bad guys shoot each other and drive off. Gravity is a thing for people with normal jobs and why drive on streets while you can simply hit it and fly over.

I am definitely not recommending this title to anyone. Skip this movie if you can.",2
Furious 7,"GOD this movie was terrible!!

First of all, it was ALL action with the most generic and cheesy plot line ever. Like really, some guy wants to find some chip which gives you ultimate hacking abilities and it's oh so powerful? PLEASE. That is incredibly dumb and cookie cutter and like, there's literally nothing original or interesting about that plot a LOT. Way to fail in originality.

Secondly, the action scenes themselves were dumb and defied all physics. Like actually though. The scene where Paul Walker is trapped in a bus that's very obviously gonna fall off a cliff, and he manages to climb it and survive because the chick just HAPPENED to get there in time? So stupid. Also, CARS FALLING FROM A PLANE AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE AND THEY ALL SURVIVE AND HAVE NO IN JURIES? What??? Like with that speed..and having their windows open like that, it makes literally no sense. Like, they would've DIED!! It was really stupid. There were several more action scenes and fight scenes that made no sense (such as the car going through three buildings in Dubai), but I'm not gonna name all of them. They were just all dumb and shot for people with no brains and who like movies that are all about ""the spectacle"" and not about substance whatsoever. This was a movie made for stupid people or people that hate thinking when watching movies, and don't critically analyze life. Literally, the kinds of people that are basic as hell.

Also, oh my god, every character had the WORST one-liners and on top of that, there was this cringe-worthy ""family"" theme that had no actual substance. It was like the directors were trying really hard to get feels out of the audience, but with terrible one liners and a cheesy plot line, it was just so bad that it was actually impossible to feel anything other than sourness and cringe when watching the movie.

ALSO, what the heck, the amount of testosterone in this movie is actually ridiculous. Like, objectifying women from the opening scenes. Way to market to your male crowd by reproducing a patriarchal bias. Ugh and it was so disgusting when the hacker girl was being treated as a sexual object by two of the main characters. Furthermore, i love how the two main female characters are SO dependent on their male counterparts. Like, one girl is pregnant and doesn't want to tell her husband because apparently being pregnant is too much for him too handle? And she deals with it alone because she's a woman right? And then of COURSE the other chick who's actually involved in action-packed scenes has amnesia and relies on Vin Diesel's character to find her self-worth and reason for doing things.

Honestly i could go on and on, but everything about the movie was so dumb. Like it was the most mindless piece of crap seller-movie that I've ever seen *cringe*. Literally making use of ""The Spectacle"" and the fact that people actually want this to win an Oscar for Best Picture MAKES ME LAUGH. That's actually the dumbest thing and most laughable thing I've ever heard!",2
Furious 7,"I think this movie is taking advantage of Paul walker's death, the storyline is non-existent (they save Ramsey from the black guy, and she tells them that the drive with the program is in abu dhabi, there is not connection from azerbaijan to abu dhabi, they meet directly with the other hacker, they enter directly in the party)the characters are stupid (vin diesel doesn't talk he only is speaking in quotes, kind like David caruso in csi Miami, Paul walker is in CGI all over the place, because Paul walker is in CGI, all the actors in the movie are a little cgi like in 300. To much action, very little logic in the action.

So at the end i give 2 as a grade because the movies was very very bad, they were sure that they will make money when Paul walker died. they were sure that everyone will go see the movie.",2
Furious 7,"There is nothing redeeming about this movie. Horrible writing, wooden acting, cliché upon cliché, insulting lack of logic or plot. The fact that $180 million were wasted to make this movie is bad enough, but the insulting assumption by the makers that this is good enough to release and the willingness by the crowd to praise it is truly mind boggling. Watching this movie is like wrestling a mattress down the stairs. Line after line made me blush in the embarrassment for the actors who had to say them. Is the only reason it is rated so high is because of the death of Paul Walker? I can' think of any other explanation. This is the type of a movie that gives Hollywood its reputation of being unable to produce an original, smart work any more.",3
Furious 7,"I'll summarize this movie with a few bulletin points:

Wooden acting. Paul Walker and Nathalie Emmanuel are decent, literally everyone else are pretty much terrible.


Cheesy one-liners. It's like this movie is from the eighties?! Loaded with cringe-worthy lines. Tyrese Gibson's character is guilty of the majority of them, and serves little purpose other than supposed comic relief.






Not sure it even warrants three stars, was thinking about giving it two. This being the last movie with Paul Walker gets it an extra star, I guess.",3
Furious 7,"All seven team members are able to win a fight from the best special forces in the world, but Toretto just don't think they are killers...

They shoot with two chain guns on one car and not even one tire gets blown. Really, that happens only in B-movies. It also never gets exciting, it's a lot like a Disney Movie. There are a lot movies that are much better, which didn't get a score like FF7.

It seems that many people gave this film a great score because of Paul Walkers death. The movie deserves the same score as a movie like G.I. Joe or The Expendables (except that movie is funny).

But it was nice to see Tony Yaa in action",3
Furious 7,"So this movie Transformers wasn't that great there were no transforming.These cars did nothing but drive and spill oil, but at least the rock was lubbed up in every shot just how he should be. The best part of the movie is seeing Mark Walhberg at the end of the movie in his tight white shirt. Ong back still taming those elephants and calling everyone ""too slow"" he to fast for the white man. My Polish grandma does better stunts then these clowns. Can't wait till transformers 8...... (WARNING NO SPOILERS) Well I thought it was going to end right here. but Nope I was misinformed that IMDb is setting a minimum of 10 freakin lines of review for this movie..I'm completely blank and have no other thought except to waste your time reading this just like i wasted my time watching this..whom ever said this was good and it was dedicated to Paully then they are idiots..the only good part was when it ended and i started a better movie.",3
Furious 7,"Furious 7 was a major disappointment. Such an amateurish attempt at movie making should be given a warning label for viewers. It is clear that the funders behind this movie had too much influence and their lack of talent showed strongly in this waste of 2 hours. They original team who wrote, produced and directed the previous ones should have been retained. Overacting, corny scenes and unrealistic scenes characterized this movie. Hopefully, Furious 8 will redeem this epic failure. The score of 9 was for Paul Walker scenes. My overall score was -12. I don't know what to say anymore as this site is forcing me to type more. I'll watch the earlier Fast and Furious movies to try and remove the memory of this one. The director needs to take a long vacation.",3
Furious 7,"James has an amazing talent, and he used it to create one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Now, visually, he manages to create some beautiful shots, and some of his action sequences are really great, in the ridiculous and beyond over the top and physics kind of way the franchise turned into. But I have to blame him for making a movie that chose the easiest and dumbest turn every time something remotely interesting or surprising could've happened. And also for the atrocity of the intro, which is basically an MTV music video.

But that takes me to the writing. Not untalented, because I really like how they, movie after movie, manage to connect the whole franchise. But as soon as they have to write the dialogue and exposition, they turn into the worst. This might be related to the fact that the lead actors are atrocious, but still.

But that takes me to the acting. How can I only blame the writers when they can't expect even one good/decent acting scene from the cast (other than Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson). Vin Diesel's acting is regressing from a very low point. The same is happening with Michelle Rodriguez. The rest never had any potential.

Whatever. The movie is terrible, it takes itself way too 90's seriously while they have cars flying in the next scene. It's a mess and a waste of James Wan.",3
Furious 7,"Overly dramatic and the scenes were all over the place.

I wont say it was the worst film of the franchise because that will forever go to Tokyo Drift (thank god the Tokyo cast was only in the movie for two minutes) but it really was not very good. At a certain point of the movie I was like ""maybe it's not good because Paul died and they had to film"" but no Paul was alive and well during 3/4 of the filming so the movie was just not good, period.

However, that ending got me. What a beautiful ending, I got goosebumps when Paul pulled up next to Vin's car and said ""you don't think you were going to leave without saying goodbye"" with a huge grin on his face, just beautiful.

It's so sad that we lost Paul and to be honest I thought they were going to kill him off in the film so I was waiting for that but when I realized they didn't I was actually relieved and touched that they chose to give him a beautiful end instead of something that would open wounds that have not fully healed among fans, friends and family.

Now my question is, will Mia and the two kids be in the next movie? I doubt it since they have been fazing her out in the past two, with her only having at most fifteen minutes during the film. Han and Gisele are gone as well (sigh so sad, they were my favorites). I hope they don't bring back the Tokyo cast cause they are horrid and well Djimon was plain olé unnecessary to me so the ultimate question is...

Where do we go from here?",3
Furious 7,"As someone mentioned before, definitely the worst movie in the series. However, three things look promising: direction and two (maybe three or four) actors who know acting (Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham; maybe Michelle Rodriguez for a moment and Kurt Russell). Others are there just to say their lines (Diesel) with absolutely flat facial expression or to smile stupidly (late Walker) and basically just to smash as many expensive cars as possible and destroy basically everything in their way with no consequences. Oh, yes: there are many ""deep philosophical"" thoughts about family, brotherhood and other cheap crap. It's not even fun any more. Reminds me of Mission impossible in a worst possible way. Well, you've probably watched first 6 sequels and you'll go for the seventh (as I did). Go then, but be warned: this movie should have not happened. Poor cars.",3
Furious 7,"Everything is so predictable in this movie. I was never a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise but the more sequels they roll out the worse they get. There are scenes where everything falls apart around a character and after 5 minutes of buildings crumbling and debris falling all over, he gets up and has almost no scratch or bruise. If I go for 10 minutes trough a dense forest I get out of there with more cuts and bruises then the guys from this movie.

For every fight scene the characters uses brand new cars. It's like they have a warehouse full of cars and they can replace them just as fast as they trash. If I start to think about it, the amount of cars that have been crashed would value more then these guys could earn in a life time.

All in all, the action was predictable and kinda unrealistic but the cars are awesome!",3
Furious 7,"First of all I'd like to say this- I respect Paul, I think he was a good actor and had a nice personality. The thing is, I did not see ALL the F&F movies, but this movie was terrible. Of course some will agree and some will not, but except for a few nice landscape shots- I did not like this movie one bit. I did not see anything new, nothing completely different from the other movies that made me say ''wow, this truly is a great movie, unlike anything I've ever seen before''. The fighting scenes were no different than some older and other action movies I've seen, the story wasn't new at all compared to the other F&F movies and other action movies... This movie actually felt like a cliché movie to me. Every single cliché of every action movie- was there. The ending was obvious, the story wasn't a bit new, this movie didn't feel new or worth watching in any way. If you're a F&F movie, you'll probably enjoy this. The reason I gave this movie 3/10 is because of the soundtrack by Wiz Khalifa, the nice landscape shots throughout the movie and the cast (Dwayne, Diesel, Paul and Michelle).",3
Furious 7,"I awarded this film 3 stars mostly out of respect to Paul Walker. Unfortunately, he's not in the film enough to elevate it over its cliché-riddled, cartoonish, incoherent final cut. Clearly, the franchise has run out of any credible plot lines. What is left is tired. Vin Diesel mumbling through his lines, espousing all things family has gotten old. Michelle Rodriguez is still suffering from memory loss, although it doesn't really add anything to the film other than to make it more frustrating. And, Dwayne Johnson takes muscle bound buffoonery to eleven. Nothing about this move makes any sense. Things happen for the sole purpose of setting up an action sequence. It's starts from the beginning, where Jason Statham shows up as the brother of the previous films baddie, Shaw. How convenient! Also, how lazy. Inserting Statham into the equation is a micro chasm of all that is wrong with this movie. Everything feels manipulated and artificial. Introducing the character of Hobbs in Fast Five was great. The chase that ensued was fun to watch, kept the movie going at a good pace, and kept all the characters involved. But, bringing The Rock back for the 6th film took the franchise where it was never meant to go. Somehow, a team of gear heads planning military style ops and having large scale shootouts is just plain silly. It's also not fun to watch. Everyone looks too old. Everyone seems like they're trying too hard to get their lines out. Ultimately, Fast and Furious 6 showed how far away from the original concept this franchise had come. Watching F&F 7 felt like watching an old episode of Scooby Do. I kept waiting for someone to come along and pull the mask off of Jason Statham to reveal the REAL bad guy. Who knows, maybe Scooby will show up in the next movie.",3
Furious 7,"This movie is mediocre at best. I fell asleep multiple times and had to rewind and watch the parts I missed.

I honestly cannot believe it is averaging 7+ stars on IMDb, maybe people feel sorry for Paul losing his life? Who knows? But I don't think it was because the movie was good. Glad I rented at Redbox and didn't see it in the theatres. I know this movie was not going to win any Oscars as Vin Diesel said it would, he is one of the lesser actors in Hollywood.

The dialogue made no sense. ""Hey, I'm about to have a baby! You should go put your life in danger, because your children will be okay without you.""

The ""action"" scenes were drawn out, with dumb camera angles that would have been better for another genre. Say, horror? What Wan is known for.

It left me yearning for more. By more I mean more substance, context, character development...things this franchise is not known for.",3
Furious 7,"This movie has drama in all the wrong places, when there is drama its corny and not believable. The action scenes are good, but overall this movie is a rental at best. Spending money on tickets and popcorn is a waste of time and money to see this at the movies. Furious not known for plots, has a weaker plot than a high school play. The director should of asked more from his actors and not let the mediocre performance go through to the final cut. The writers, what writers. There are many fights and not one drop of blood, not that I was wanting blood, but it lends to the believability or lack of for the fight scenes. Was the special effects guy on vacation, guess so, there's always catchup, which would have fit well into this lackluster direction. RIP Paul Walker.",3
Furious 7,"Spoilers ahead... Just... REALLY? The action don't make sense, the writing is awful, the acting is a disgrace and well cars jumping through buildings, people surviving a fall of hundreds of meters inside a car that's rolling down a cliff, people getting from one car to another thought the windows while the two cars spin around one another in the middle of a drone persecution, a person that breaks his arm cast only with the pressure that his muscle provides, and why do you take a tech to track people through the internet with you to every single mission, it function through the INTERNET!!. Well I know is an action movie and you can always take a few licenses, but really?",3
Furious 7,"I have never wrote a movie review so far, but this film got me so ""furious"" after leaving the theater that I had to express my disbelief in IMDb. The plot is very, very weak, but given the franchise, this is not such a problem as we all are expecting more action, racing and effects than a good story.

Yet they took the good things in the franchise way too far. The stunts are defying the law of physics and common sense in such a ridiculous matter that it is laughable instead of enjoyable.

The characters are getting worse and worse with each movie, a bunch of racers and mechanics who fight on even terms with world deadliest secret agents or can hack everything. I don't know who decided that every character in the movie should be a super hero, but that decision and its execution were extremely poorly made. To the point where The Avengers is more realistic movie than Furious 7.

The only positive from the movie is the Paul Walker tribute, yet this cannot justify the high score in IMDb or the movie as a whole.",3
Furious 7,This was supposed to be a franchise where car racing or car chase based action was supposed to take centre stage! Cars parachuting down on to the highway?? Come on!! I would rather see A-Team where they shoot ammo from the tank to guide it mid air. This movie seemed more like a spin off from Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol!! And as the movie progressed it was less about Statham finishing his younger brother's fight and more about generic geeky mumbo jumbo stuff. It would have been awesome if the whole movie was a cat and mouse game between Statham and Diesel. The chemistry between Paul Walker and Diesel was almost non-existent may be be because Paul(may his soul be at peace) passed away before those scenes were shot. And I may be the very few who feel this way but the tribute to Paul Walker was not THAT impressive. Very clichéd. And I am going to watch Eight Below to remember the good sensitive Actor that Paul was. I hope the series ends with this movie. And please let James Bond or Ethan Hunt take over such plots.,3
Furious 7,"this movie is not a good movie and a huge let down and this is why, toretto vs shaw fight is a huge disappointment and a huge let down. shaw couldn't hit anything instead he is getting a huge beating by toretto. the ending of this movie is also disappointing. toretto and his crew ended up fighting jakande who is the secondary villain and not shaw who is the main villain.i hate both vin diesel and james wan. vin diesel is a huge asshole and james wan is a dumbass idiotic director. this movie doesn't make any sense in fact this movie gives me a bad headache. if you think that this 2 hour and 17 minutes action movie is good, than you are wasting your time watching it. it almost gave me a headache to try and make sense of the plot while stifling through countless flaws in the movie. This is a pretty darn bland movie with some poor editing and super cheesy and poorly executed action sequences. Mainly because of the camera execution, it was just lame from start to finish. The acting is pretty bad and seems like regular civilians with shaved heads, some muscle and a beard participated. Or guys that just look slick or a bit geeky played these roles. I like watching movies where it's survival of the fittest, but this movie was boring. I have seen much better from amateur youtube videos and much entertaining as well. Vin Diesel for most the time, looked like he didn't know what he was doing. The movie is about two hours and seventeen minutes and they try to milk every second of it. Because apparently movies have to be at least 2 hour and 17 minutes or close to it. Sure this can play a part in the story, but not when it's constantly shown over and over again. This is a action movie, but just about all of the action in this movie is downright stupid and doesn't make any sense. The story seems like something someone can come up with in like an hour by just sitting and writing. Even the interactions between characters was so bad, cliché and boring. Just pass on this one, it's a waste of time. I give this movie a 3 because they seem to have tried really hard to make a cool, stylish quasi video game style movie.",3
Furious 7,"to make it really short ... this film unfortunately offers nothing except a lot of ruckus and noise and one explosion after another and ridiculously unrealistic action scenes. It's not even comparable with the other parts before. here everything was ascended, that action cinema and the special effects industry has to offer. way too much in my opinion to pay attention until the end.

spoiler:

it was for me in the whole movie, unfortunately, only a single scene that touched me ... the final scene, when the cars of Vin and Paul (who already couldn't play this scene) at the fork road drift apart. that was more impressive than all the noise in the film.",3
Furious 7,"Which is worse, the writing (which is borrowed from a hundred other movies) or the acting (this crew has nary an actor among them?

This predictable joke has an utterly unbelievable series of wonderful action sequences. That is, you can't take your eye off em. But they make this cornball fluff too long and eventually even boring. There is an interminable fight scene during the last 20 minutes that was just pointless.

The guys I was with were laughing at the wrong places, the hackneyed plot, set-ups, fights, everything but the car chases.

Don't go. Let poor Paul rest in peace.",3
Furious 7,"I know you don't take action films seriously. But action scenes in this movie are so illogical and stupid, I need to write a book on it to explain. But it's not worth even to write a detailed review.

Cars flying from airplane, cars jumping across 3 buildings?? Come on. And just to do some show-off, casts travel from LA to Tokyo and Abu Dhabi, without any reason?

Storyline is so sloppy, even a 5th standard student can write better story. And plot is so dumb and pathetic.

I was wondering how can a sane person who knows how good movies are created can like this one. And then I saw its IMDb rating as 8.1. And I was really shocked. 8.1 rating for such a movie? Really? Can't believe it.

Looks like this movie is popular just because its name and cast. Never waste your precious time on such idiot movie. There are thousands of good movies to watch than wasting your time on this crap.",3
Furious 7,"I was surprised by the fact this film is so inept , randomly plotted, hastily put together , indifferently acted and clumsily directed (James Wan directed this?). I consider my self a fan of Big budget brainless action pop corn films , however this is nothing but a series of ""money shots"" , (the skyscraper jump, the airplane jump, the bus dangling over the cliff) thinly glued with the flimsiest excuse of a plot about a shadowy bad guy , a lady ""hacker"" (another throw away character), and a government agent. Ultimately we come away none the wiser, save for the knowledge that Dom would rather lay on a beach drinking corona with his buddies and ""family"" (ha! family values!) than fight his evil adversaries and save the civilized world from terrorists. But that's what he does and what he is going to keep doing in the inevitable sequels. And it's a pity to see Kurt Russell in this wreck, but even by Jason Statham standards, this film sets a new low. It all ultimately adds to this: The audience will flock to see on the big screen the over the top Hi-tech Hi-Def Hijinks promised in the preview trailer , no matter if the audience's intelligence will be grossly insulted by the producers of this pile of crap. A worrisome conclusion for the current state of cinematic affairs.",3
Furious 7,"""Hahahahahaha!"" That's what I kept saying throughout this intellectually insulting and predicable movie. This movie came from the brain child of an 11 year old! Wow! They actually far exceeded my expectations of the ridiculousness I knew would ensue while going into this movie and all the typical phrases and clichés are present. It has the heart of Sharknado injected into the fabric of the F&F universe. I have seen all of the F&F movies. Furious 7, however, took the franchise to whole new level of preposterous.

The whole Furious crew is after this guy Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) because he killed the snack eating Japanese guy, Han. But in order to get to him they have to team up with Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) who is after some sci-fi tech called the God's Eye that was created by this hacker, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), whom some private terrorist group have captured. This computer chip has the ability to see every camera, hear every microphone, ATM, computer, in the world to instantly locate anyone on the planet. For some unspoken political reasons all US agencies have been ruled out to find Ramsey and the chip, which is why, of course, they need Dom and his team. If the Furious gang steals the tech then Mr. Nobody will let them use it to find Shaw.

Of course the government affords them tricked out cars to go find this special chip. A 4x4 '69 Dodge Charger is the first thing that comes to my mind when I need to chase bad guys. Does Dom always have to drive a '69 Charger? He drives like 4 of them in this movie!

One of the many things that do not make sense in this plot is whenever they are after this chip, Shaw conveniently shows up as well, I guess, to get the computer chip too or he is chasing the 7 crew? We never know much about Shaw or where he is throughout the movie; he just magically appears whenever it is convenient for him to be in the plot. This happens more than once. But isn't the reason they are after the chip is in order to get Shaw? So why don't they stop chasing after this chip and everyone direct their energies at Shaw while he is there? No, they want to get away from him first, get the tech they need, to ultimately put themselves back in the same situation they were in when he showed up unexpectedly to then exact revenge. And if he is actually chasing the F&F gang (w/o sounding too logical :/ ) then why not just wait for him to show up instead of risking their lives for some computer chip?

The final showdown of this movie is too long to go into here as there would be too much to write. Basically it is one unbelievable piece of action after another. One highlight was when Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is in the hospital and flexes his broken arm in a cast to break it off. WHAT!? Later when he crashes the EMT truck over the bridge at the exact moment the drone is flying under to blow it up was when I seriously lost it and broke out in laughter! There should be a category for movies that are hilarious when they aren't meant to be. And just think, the first movie portrayed everyone (except for Paul Walker's character who was trained F.B.I.) as common street racing thieves in L.A. to this movie where they are now practically trained operative spies taking down mercenaries and chased by missile launching drones. Each subsequent movie becomes more out of touch with reality than the previous. But this one outdid the last and I wonder what was the director James Wan thinking when he approved of all this? What will the next one be named, ""Fast and Furious 8 in Space""?

With all of that said, it was still entertaining to watch, like bubble gum for the mind. Even if there is no sensible plot it is still watchable for the laughs almost like Naked Gun (1988) or Airplane (1980). That is kind of sad considering they really can't make a spoof version of this franchise because it is already woven into the films. The characters do not need much development since we know who they are already, which allows for more time to focus on crazy stunts and absurd action. The cars are quite cool, though the focus is no longer on the cars or racing, but more on revenge, espionage, and heist and some short side-show soap opera scenes.

The very end was somewhat redeeming to this wacky flick and actually the best part of the whole movie; it kind of got to me. I felt they did an enduring send off for Paul Walker and his character, though it really didn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie. They created a smooth double entendre monologue to say goodbye to Brian the character while actually meaning goodbye, Paul. The top view shot of them in their cars riding side by side to then see them split on different paths was moving and fit perfectly with their friendship, passion for cars, and his exit from the series.

However good the end was, 5 minutes does not outweigh 2 hours. You cannot legitimately give this movie a 10 because of that. I think Paul Walker would have been shaking his head left and right and sinking further in seat if he were at the premiere. ""Sorry Paul"" is what the end should have said for making his last movie so bad.

3/10. 2 stars for action and entertainment. 1 star for Paul Walker tribute.",3
Furious 7,"I am a long time fan of The Fast and the Furious series. Watching it evolve as a franchise over the years has been a great joy and a lot of fun. From the early 2000's feel of the first two to the high octane of the last two, it has been an interesting series to follow. It's great action and fun characters are what has kept audiences coming back again and again. This is why I'm sad to say Furious 7 doesn't deliver in any way.

Firstly, the story was a convoluted mess that ultimately made little sense. It's an action movie, I get it, sometimes you've got to turn off your brain. Even if a plot is predictable, it should at least make sense. Furious 7 sees Jason Statham, who was teased at the end of the last film, take on the gang for nearly killing his brother. The trailers advertised the film as Statham vs. the F&F crew, but really it's about them working for the government to get a hacker, to find a program, that they need for reasons, and Djimon Hounsou is an angry warlord. The story never feels like it's sensibly going anywhere, and even if it's all just a setup for action sequences, it barely serves to do that. Nothing is connected and ultimately it's hard to care about what's happening, or for the characters involved.

This is where Furious 7 is weakest, it drops everything about the characters that was great. They spew one liners with little passion, Toretto hamfistedly preaches about family to pad length into scenes between set pieces, and everyone else has become a parody of themselves and a stereotype of their race. Jason Statham is completely wasted as his story is sidelined for another. His sole purpose is to show up in every action piece at the worst time to cause trouble for the gang. That's all he does, just show up and kind of make things harder. Along with Statham, Hounsou and Tony Jaa are also wasted in the role of vague villains who don't really seem to have any motives outside of being really evil. Hounsou is an underrated gem, as is Jaa and it was really good to see him in some Hollywood cinema. Too bad neither has much to say nor are they given a shot to deliver anything other than ""bad guy dialogue.""

The action is partly the only thing that makes the movie bearable. It keeps things going and at times it is really exciting, particularly thanks to the direction of James Wan. Wan's really only other foray into action cinema was the immensely underrated 2007 film ""Death Sentence."" Unfortunately, all of Wan's creative tricks and ideas can only do so much with what is already a stupid script. Without spoiling too much, the action scenes are a mix of high octane, on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement and physics that push what I previously thought possible to exist within the realm of suspended disbelief. When the characters survive so many impossible feats, it all becomes a wacky show of what will they do next? There is no suspense by the end of the film, you know that despite how ridiculous it is, they'll all be fine. Let's just say the scene in the trailer with the car flying between two buildings in Abu Dabi is a lot more absurd in the actual film, and I lost my self cracking up in the theater.

Finally, let's talk about the manipulation of the film. We all know what happened during filming, Rest In Peace Paul Walker. The ending was a nice send off, with Vin Diesel musing about brotherhood. It feels real, all though out of place with the story, but it comes across as genuine. That is until CGI Demon Walker shows up to look into Diesel's soul with glassy eyes that hold the gaze of hell. Seriously, how did they think they could pull that off? The scene on storyboard must have looked really good. Walker pulls up next to Diesel, they share a final moment, and then drive off into the sunset in different directions. They could have achieved this with many other means, considering the real Walker was dead, but no, they had to reanimate him in cold, creepy, uncanny valley digital animation.

This final scene could have been a nice send off, but instead it came across as a cheap manipulation to get the audience to feel nostalgic. After an entire ridiculous movie with a ridiculous end to the action, we get treated to a sappy bit shot at what has to be the warmest beach in California. It was sad he passed away so young, he seemed like a decent guy. This ""tribute"" felt more like ""tear bait"" injected in to trick the audience into feeling like they watched a tribute to the career of a great man. Too bad it was just Furious 7. Again, R.I.P. Paul Walker.",3
Furious 7,"They should rename the movie, ""Fast and Curious 7,"" because I still don't know what went on in the movie. I remember some Korean guy seeking revenge for his brother's death. The rest of the movie is somewhat of a two hour blur of gun fire, and muscle cars.

There are some extremely hot characters in the movie; Nathalia Emmanuel, Tyrese Gibson, and Dwayn Johnson to name a few. I say Tyrese and Dwayn because my date kept moaning every time, Tyrese was shown in a scene, and off course, Dwayn, ""The Rock,"" Johnson's muscles protruded from every inch of his body.

My knees went weak when I laid eyes on, ""The Gorgeous Michelle Rodriguez."" I have to give the movie 3 stars, because the producers of this movie was smart enough to hire, Michelle. If you go to movies just to see hot characters like the ones I mentioned this is the movie for you. But don't even think about looking at Michelle; I got dibbs.

What went on in that movie?? Scratching my head.",3
Furious 7,"I've seen the first movie, so i got this free premiere tickets so why not? I thought i was going to watch a cars movie...guess i was wrong.

Looked like a movie scripted by 5 male teenagers on a hot summer afternoon, full of nonsense. I can't even describe, that would take hours to explain everything. I could talk about every dumb scene, but it would be too much of an effort, here's one:

The Rock is on hospital because by miracle he managed to get harmed, after something, he breaks its arm's plaster by flexing it, gets an FBI bullet proof vest out of nowhere (because hospitals...) then drives an ambulance and proceeds to fall on the top of a drone armed with missiles, and naturally he gets drone's mini-gun. The amount of nonsense is so unreal i almost felt like leaving the cinema room.

This was honestly the worst movie I've seen on cinema. Nonsense physics, nonsense ideas (How to get on the most private party in the world? You just need to get some invitations out of nothing), dumb fights, almost no races, hot girls to give credibility, i can't even explain everything in 1000 words honestly.

The only decent thing i found was the final 3 minutes or so, the Paul Walker tribute, and that is worth of the 2 starts out of the 3 i give to the movie, that scene was really awesome and worth, that and probably one or 2 comedy moments.

As for the rest, you can't even enjoy the movie, you can't fit it on the ""so bad it's good"". You can get more entertained watching transformers.",3
Furious 7,"The seventh instalment in the explosive racing turned heist franchise, which has surprisingly seen more mileage than expected, is finally upon us, a year later than scheduled due to the untimely demise of its lead protagonist, Paul Walker. The film is ultimately a celebration of his memory and his contribution to the long running series, which he launched in 2001.

Following their defeat of Owen Shaw and his team, the crew are able to enjoy their reprieve and lead domesticated lives. However, unbeknownst to them, they are now the subject of a crusade led by Shaw's sibling, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), who is seeking retribution for his brother.

Given the series' transition from racing to all out vehicular warfare, it is imperative that the action sequences are executed well. Therein lies the film's predominant success. If you thought the plane sequence on the longest runway known to man was a stretch, Furious 7 requires an even greater suspension of disbelief, what with airborne cars leaping across building, off cliffs and from an active aircraft as well.

In going overboard with the action, the story is considerably compromised in the process. A paper thin narrative is accompanied by the lack of palpable consequences for the principal characters. Somehow, they always manage to recover from every collision and accident unscathed, which makes proceedings credulous and less realistic. Moreover, the primary cast's vibrant chemistry and exotic locales spanning several countries is a prominent feature as ever. Sadly, Jason Statham is relegated to being a generic nemesis and lacks his customary swagger. The latest chapter also adds new blood in the form of veteran thespian Kurt Russell, Thai action star Tony Jaa, UFC athlete Ronda Rousey and Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel, all of which feature in glorified cameos.

The relentless flurry of action also includes several epic confrontations between certain characters. While the muscle men all lock horns, the pick of the bunch is a brutal altercation between two women, namely Michelle Rodriguez and the aforementioned Rousey. In a testosterone fuelled movie, it is a pleasant surprise that the latter shines through when afforded a larger role. All of the brawls are extremely well choreographed.

In a franchise which has always emphasized the significance of family and brotherhood, the final tribute to Paul Walker is particularly poignant. An emotional send-off is matched by a few resonating dialogues, representing a beautiful farewell to the actor.

Slick and stylish but devoid of much substance, the series is showing no signs of slowing down. While it won't be the same without Paul Walker, with three more sequels in the pipeline, the sky's the limit.",4
Furious 7,"The (original) Fast and the Furious was a great movie, purely set on illegal racing, money and turf wars. By Fast and Furious 7, the movie franchise evolved into a Die Hard / Mission Impossible and Expendables type movie with more bullshit than all 3 movies above put together.

I am actually ashamed by looking at the stats that: 48,262 people (or bots) voted this 10/10, followed by; 23,548 people (or bots) voted this 9/10.

F&F7 is the same as F&F 6, or 5 or 4. The same recycled jokes, tacky quotes and cheesy personalities.

None of the actors (or actresses) gave a performance strong enough to immerse you into the movie. As a result, you are left focusing on the bullshit unfold from a flying car enter between 3 tower buildings without hitting a concrete level, or Jason Statham randomly appearing between Abu-Dhabi, US, and various other regions where the F&F team have just rendezvoused.",4
Furious 7,"This movie should be categorized as Sci-Fi. The actors and their cars are, defying the laws of physics, they're all psychic, as it seems, there's too much CGI, everything is exaggerated, emotions seem fake, I could go on... so this makes just another cliché American movie. I did find the movie funny because of all the exaggeration though and I did LOL a few times :)

I just want to say one more thing about this. The overly hight rating is just because of Paul. Paul R.I.P. But people, giving high ratings to movies because of deceased actors, you're just promoting dead actors and that's not O.K. Please stop. Rate the movie as it is, objectively.",4
Furious 7,"The best part of this movie was the Paul Walker tribute and I don't think I will watch furious 8 in the future. I have to say that without Paul Walker fast and furious will never ever be the same. I enjoy watching one-six because them films had an good plot and the actors did good in those films. I was really hoping for Furious 7 to be good and I was disappointed.

Furious 7,"There is no doubt that the studio went through a hard time trying to complete the film after the tragic death of actor Paul Walker. It's never easy to as seen in other films in the same situation. The only other choice was to scrap the film altogether; however, if that was the case, we wouldn't have to worry about reviewing it.

If you take into account this difficulty while watching Furious Seven, you'll see that the studio actually did a great job piecing together what they had into a watchable film. They were dealt a bad hand, but they finished the best that they could. If I were to take this into account when rating the film it would be a solid 7 or 8.

Fortunately, I'm not going to rate a movie based on any other factors but the movie itself; and with that: It's disappointing to say that this series' quality has drastically decreased. Furious Seven can easily be argued to be the worst in the series--yes, even before 2 Fast 2 Furious.

Some of the action scenes, albeit nice to look at, abandon any realm of realism that existed in previous episodes. It seems as if the producers decided to get more and more ridiculous with each passing sequel. Considering their films have made well over 3 billion dollars, it's understandable that they would continue. If you as a viewer are fine with watching a film whose only positive feature is a few scenes of action absurdities, look no further. Feel free to exit this review here. But if you're a viewer who wants a bit more out of a film, then you may want to pass on this one and look elsewhere.

The plot jumps around, the scenes appear a tad out of place (given the death of walker) and the new characters are given no development that connects you to them or the plot itself. Perhaps worse of all, the acting of some of the cast was definitely poor; less than what I have seen in previous episodes. Some scenes give off a forced-sentimentality feeling. It's almost as if the film was rushed. All of these things made watching this movie too distracting and withdrew me from the even sub-par immersion that I expect a film to bring me into.

When your movie seems less like fun and more like work to watch, something is terribly wrong. This studio may continue to care more about the profit than the quality of the film, but if they decide to make a sequel (which they would be crazy to) and care about more than just that, they should start learning alchemy and turn trash into gold.",4
Furious 7,"Such a disaster the movie was. I'm not going into continuity, but this movie have failed all the laws of physics. How could someone just jump from one car into the window of another car, that too both the cars were at high speed and both the cars were drifting!! At the right time Dwayne Johnson came out of his . How could fly an international chopper with a drone, with the police department haven't even a clue. Jason Statham brother was in a hospital and he killed 90% staff over there along with security guards and also destroyed the hospital. How could he get the treatment now?

Lot more, if you want to know just see this movie.",4
Furious 7,"I had no enthusiasm for this film. None. I hadn't seen any F&F movies since Tokyo Drift, because I am the wrong type of person for these films. I like the action genre, sure, but this is an aggressively dumb franchise and I usually see Scorsese, Tarantino, Ridley Scott or Spielberg films. But I had no idea that a movie where people drive cars out of an aeroplane, drive a car from one of the Etihad Towers into the other and the Rock breaks his cast off his arm by flexing his muscles would actually make me all emotional at the end. In a year stuffed with action films, this was actually one of the better ones too. Yes, the laws of physics are raped about as much as that A-Team movie, but I'll give any dumb movie a pass if it delivers on the action.

Well played, movie.",4
Furious 7,I get it. Action doesn't need to be realistic but the action in this is downright silly. Also FF needs to stop projecting Vin's character as Superman. Only redeeming thing in this film were the physical fight sequences.,4
Furious 7,"This film should have never been made. Paul Walker died in a manner. That this franchise has made it's living off of. Promoting ignorant behavior behind the wheel.

This movie made a killing and solely on one mans demise. Paul went out in a horrific manner and he didn't deserve this turd stain to cap it off.

There is no plot to discuss. The acting is on par with Adult films. Vin Diesel is a never was scrub cashing in. If the man had any taste or respect. He would have asked to had Paul's part removed.Or even better asked to have the series dropped. Had Paul's part been removed. We all would have know why and it isn't like it would have messed with any story. There is no story.

Furious 7,"First of all,I really want to like this movie because I love Paul Walker.I even tried to convince myself that the movie wasn't so bad.But,there you have it.This movie is just boring,and they are getting too optimistic.They got 3 more entries in the pipeline,and they somehow think that after seeing this farce,people still care about this franchise.After 2 good entries,the franchise slumps again with a movie with so many plot holes,even such an amazing cast cannot fill them up.Why does the team work so hard to find Shaw even when he literally shows up wherever they go? And how does he show up there anyway? This family thing has become very boring by now.Djimon Hounsou's talents are wasted yet again and this time,his character does not make any difference at all.There is no limit to what these guys can do.Somehow they stay alive even after their car falling of cliffs.Come on! How much time do they think this stupidity will go unnoticed? The tribute to Paul Walker is extremely poignant and is a very good send off for him.Never thought a Fast &Furious movie would make me cry.

This movie favours implausible car stunts more than necessary narrative focus.In the end,this thing just becomes a fantasy movie without the intrigue.",4
Furious 7,"Well, what can you say about the movie? Yes, it was Paul Walkers last movie. I get that. What I don't get is why people have rated this so highly. It is improbable/impossible action scene followed by badly acted clichéd lines followed by yet more improbably/impossible action scenes, clichéd lines, improbable...yet get the idea. It's like they sat down and said ""How can we make this movie more like Transformers: Age of Extinction? That was a dumb movie but people still turned out in droves to watch it."" As one user-reviewer noted, you have to suspend belief after 5 minutes and keep it suspended until the tribute at the end. I'd only add that you need to suspend more than just belief, you also need to suspend any hopes or expectations that this is a good movie. Then you might just enjoy it.",4
Furious 7,"I appreciate it when a movie requires you to check your brain at the door, so imagine how much I might like a movie that requires you to check two brains at the door.

Full disclosure: this was the first of the Fast and Furious movies I've seen. I thought they wouldn't be my cup of tea. Meh. I was right.

Having never seen the other movies, I wasn't sure whether this group of heroes were supposed to be super-heroes or normal people. After all, they surely do things that aren't possible, like survive falling several stories from buildings or taking brutal physical damage in street fights. I was really impressed that no rocket could harm them, and bullet hits seem reserved only for extras.

It's hard to tell whether any of them can act, especially when given single lines that have none of that tongue-in-cheek guile that Arnold Schwarzenegger used to deliver so well. Specifically, Vin Diesel's stilted monotone confused me, because if he just slightly winked after each line, it would've been a comedic command performance for the ages. Sadly, the deceased Paul Walker is the only one who seems to have had any acting chops, and Kurt Russell gets to ham it up with glee.

I never learned how to drive a manual transmission, so watching a lot of clutch releasing and hard shifting was not as erotic for me as it was for the rest of the audience. The whole affair is certainly heteronormative, what with all the hot women scantily clad and the dudes competing for their attention. The movie fulfills all the requisite stereotypes, clichés, tropes, patterns, and formulas. The studio's algorithm knows how to make a movie.

Most problematic is not that the heroes could never survive or pull off any of their actions, but that their plans make no sense, and no one would act the way they do. This seems like a film wanting to make a new superhero franchise, yet the superheroes simply drive awesome cars really, really well. At 137 minutes, it runs about 37 minutes too long, and I almost left at the two-hour mark out of sheer boredom.

But I did stay to watch the ""tribute"" to Paul Walker, and although I believe a woman next to me cried a little, I had to stifle laughter at the horrible delivery of Vin Diesel, whose sadness of losing a brother belied the entire film's heterosexual vibe.

It's apparently okay to admit you love your brother, but only after he's dead.

Grade: -7.",4
Furious 7,"While the things happening in the first movie of the franchise were highly improbable, they were, mostly, possible. That was the most interesting thing, you were like ""that can't happen"", but after some thought you were like ""ahh, it actually could"".

By this 7. installment, all the reality is out of the window, going all the way through the windows of the surrounding buildings. It's way too much and leaves you wandering ""why?"". There are many ways to create suspense and thrill without resorting to such things. This is not a Sci-Fi movie. What's more, they did it before, so, again, why not now?

The acting is pretty flat, too. Sure, in this kind of a movie, what do you expect? Actually, by the 7. installment and ""everyone back together again"", you do expect more. Those are more experienced actors playing more experienced people. Yet, none of that shows, really.

Well, expect on Jordana Brewster. It's really amazing how much different she looks now. You may think she's beautiful or not, but she sure is hardly recognizable. She tries to play her character like a mature, responsible mom, but even she just doesn't fare well.

Of course, it's not all bad. It's watchable, but there are many better movies of this type to watch.",4
Furious 7,"The lifeblood and virtually only redeeming factor in this film-- aside from a couple of the car sequences--is the emotional backbone of character continuity. Elephant in the room, Paul Walker but also Diesel, Rodriguez, etc. Without that, this is just an absurd maelstrom of cars and bullets and buffoonery. Most of the action is just staged chaos, most of the humor is unfunny and most of the story is contrived setups for the action, as well as emotional exploitation.

Granted, one should not go into this film expecting anything different from all of that, but even so I think that this film can basically be filed under ""escalate by any means possible."" The ending hits the bittersweet beats that the audience expects, and that alone is worth something, but the couple of hours leading up to the ending constitute a a big, crazy mess, entertaining perhaps depending on one's tastes but not anything worth high praise. Take that for what it is.",4
Furious 7,"I saw a couple of the early Fast & Furious movies, but this is the first one I've seen in a few years. Was a little surprised about how many of the original cast are still in the movies. Having taken a look at some of the actors biographies this is even more surprising.

The fact that this is the first of the Fast & Furious movies I've seen in a few years indicates that it isn't a genre that I'm passionate about. The plot and script take a resounding second fiddle to the action. The movie follows the revenge of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who's brother must have been killed by the gang in a previous movie. The action sequences are undoubtedly what the movie is all around. There is absolutely no doubt that if you loved the previous franchise movies you'll love this one as well!! Bearing in mind the box office figures it seems that there are plenty of people who love this movie.",4
Furious 7,I didn't liked the movie at all they lost it after fast and furious 4 in my opinion all the other movies they are about the money i liked the scene with Vin and Paul. I liked how they said goodbye ... But it was just very bad the story was ..... no words they shouldn't make a new movie but they will again only for the money ... Watch it if your a fan of the movies but i don't think you will like it a lot. I was expecting again more from the movie and in the end i was like why i payed to see this movie.... Vin played good and the other cast but the brother of Paul i didn't liked him so much i think he is not an actor (i read it somewhere),4
Furious 7,"The filmmakers did the best they could in gluing what pieces they had together, but the fact is, this is an incomplete movie that is unengaging until the final two minute Paul Walker tribute - which isn't ""really"" part of the movie's story proper. Of course, there was really no way around this. The series main protagonist is ""present"" in the movie, but is himself not really engaged in any of the movie's happenings. Whatever Walker's original story arc was, and whatever footage he shot for it was clearly mostly excised. Given that this was intended to be the 1st movie in a new F&F ""trilogy"" then this obviously had to be done, as there was no way there could ever be a continuance or payoff to the story arc without Walker. His arc is instead replaced by Diesel and Jordanna Brewster talking about how Walker wants to be a good dad and is 'over' being Fast & Furious as a setup for his eventual exit at the end... but he's not really involved in these conversations, as that wasn't the original plan.

Nevertheless, you can't simply remove the protagonist from the story and remain engaged. And make no mistake, though Vin Diesel has given himself top billing ever since becoming a producer on 4Fast-4-4ious, these films have always primarily been about ""Brian O'Connor's"" journey, with Toretto as the deuteragonist in the later movies. And when you remove Walker's character, all you're left with is ""spectacle"", and Vin Diesel trying to be Superman. Regarding spectacle, this movie has few equals. However, it's ultimately meaningless if your protagonist is disconnected from it and has no stake in it. Regarding Diesel, his character simply isn't interesting without Walker as a foil and can't carry a movie on his own. His only real character connection is to Letty. Han is dead, Roman & Tej had established relationships with each other and Brian O'Conner in 2Fast2Furious, but never really establish a rapport with Toretto. The glue of this ""family"" was Paul Walker's character, and now he's gone. Nobody wanted to see Diesel as an unstoppable action hero in XXX or Riddick, and it doesn't play here either.

Aside from the aforementioned issues which were directly related to Walker's death, this movie has a few more issues. The first of which, is that it totally glosses over the death of Han. His death and bringing justice to his killer is the WHOLE MOTIVATION for the larger story. I have a feeling this aspect may have been affected by Walker's death, as they didn't want to dwell too much on character who died in a fiery car wreck like Walker did in real life. However, it didn't do the story any favors to be almost dismissive of the incident providing the characters motivation. Furthermore, it didn't make any sense for Sean Boswell - who spent a whole movie being mentored by Han, and thus has the strongest connection to him - to only show up for a cameo and NOT to join the team in trying to avenge him. Wasted opportunity to truly incorporate Tokyo Drift in with the main series. Finally, Jason Statham is by far the biggest ""name"" to be cast as the villain in a F&F movie, and I feel like they kind of botched it. The movie goes off on a tangent with Djimon Hounsou and Statham sort of disappears and didn't get the chance to shine as the villain like all the lesser names in previous installments got to. Really, too bad. F&F needs to learn the ""Batman"" lesson that more villains isn't better. Furthermore, there's no point in bringing in badass Jason Statham if Toretto can just straight up beat him up. You've completely neutered his character, killed any dramatic tension and there's no point to even casting Jason Statham then.

So, in conclusion, the movie was irreparably harmed by Walker's death. But even if it hadn't, there still would've been several missteps in it. If the plan for the future installments is Diesel as Superman, just kill the franchise now. On the plus side though, the stunts and ""spectacle"" aspect of the movie was top notch.",4
Furious 7,"This was one movie I've waited a long time to see. And it just didn't live up to the expectations. My taste may be a bit different then the general audience, but for me The first one and even Tokyo Drift were the gems. This one had a mwah ending but for the rest... its just plain silly. From someone who can enjoy a superhero movie without saying thats not possible, nor is that.. this one made me say it almost the entire movie.

I hope the series stops now. I cant see any way they could bring the spice back in as it had before. If you want to see this movie.... wait till it comes on Netflix or some sort. It really isn't worth the time.",4
Furious 7,"I don't even know where to start but this film was perhaps the most mind numbing action film I've seen for a long time. Definitely not worth going to theaters. That's it in a nutshell.

Fast and Furious has come a long way from the first movie to its seventh installment. Franchise is very popular and hence the high amount of sequels. I genuinely liked the first one and few sequels were okay too. But now, director James Wan tries to poke the series with his ""vision"" that seems more like a producers and studios vision. Director has made a lot of good horror movies which I like a lot. Seemingly the guy can technically make a fast paced action films like this one too but the end result lacks charisma and is very messy with music video style fast cuts, shaky cams, ""camera rolls"" and what not. This is a movie for ADHD generation for sure since its mostly hard to make out anything what's happening on the screen. Viewer is filled with constant stream of V8 growl, fist fights, missiles blowing up, cars flying trough mountain cliffs, cars flying trough sky scrapers, ... well you get the point. You can leave your brains home if you go see this. There is very little drama or calm moments and when there is such, the dialog is juvenile and ultra clichéd. ""I should have done that long time ago"", ""I belong home and I love you forever after"", etc etc. Such poor and uninspired writing. Even much poorer than I though is possible for this franchise.

So the script was pretty ridiculous with a lot taken from James Bond, Oceans Eleven series or your generic buddy agent film. I guess they are starting to run out of ideas if they have to transform a street racing subculture film into an agent romp with bullets flying. FF was never about guns or ""breaking in to top secret facility with a team of highly skilled specialist"". Script was just all over the place with explosions, fist fights, going to random places, throwing forgettable one liners... That saddened me. Cars and racing culture were not in the limelight. I was so begging the film to end midways since there was too much non-stop generic action that I've seen million times before. There is absolutely nothing new and memorable in this film you haven't seen in any b-class action movie already.

Physics and realism were totally forgot and people jumped from high speed moving cars to asphalt, rolled 100 meters down a mountain cliff, had head-to-head car crash, got hit multiple times with iron bar, flew from fourth floor landing on top of a car, and all this without characters barely sustaining a scratch! Wow. This is actually more superhero movie than Avengers because you can't kill those guys! I expect mindless action movies at least have a decent respect to laws of physics and human body. Oh yeah, and then there was a scene with cars dropped from a plane and landing perfectly on the tiny road many kilometers below them. Just splendid... Also the action and sfx wasn't that spectacular either and I'm truly baffled how they managed to spend 190M on this. They actually used stickers as ""bullet holes"" on cars in many shots. Last time I saw that being done was some Steven Seagal movie from 90s. Surely there was lots of cars being wrecked but somehow it all seemed bland perhaps because of fast cutting or shaky cam.

I will give this 4 instead of 3 just because of the touching montage and salute they put for Paul Walker at the end. Too damn shame that he passed away since I liked him a lot as an actor and he seemed like a nice guy. He would have deserved a lot better movie than this unmemorable piece of action mess.",4
Furious 7,"This series has been showing numerous numbers of unrealistic stuffs. And I've been quite enjoying them honestly. But this seventh film has just broken the limit. Now it's just ridiculous. They used to show few innovations in the previous films. But this time they've probably figured, ""Hey, we've gotten the fans hooked. We've brought in a new star, and a core star died. So there's no way this one need anything new. We'll just repeat 50% stuffs from the previous movies, steal another 20% from other franchises and add a lot of clichés to fill in the rest.""

I didn't expect the cast to do any legendary acting, but the least they could do is actually be in ""character"" during the filming. All of the actors were like just ""being themselves"".

And about the stunts and CGIs, be as ridiculous as you want just represent is somewhat believable. The subplots are probably some of the worsts. ""God's Eye"", seriously? Seriously they expect to sell this crappy idea??

The only reason this film is this much successful is because of the death of Paul Walker. There I've said it.",4
Furious 7,"Yes, I know this film is designed to be merely some fun (mindless) action/ entertainment (well, I sure hope that was the intention), but it falls short of even that.

I can understand the need for suspension of disbelief when viewing this type of film, but these plot contrivances were beyond incredulous. (Spoiler) The God's-Eye story arc was unreasonably far-fetched to begin with, but the further sub-plot about it being sold to an Arabian Billionaire was completely inane.

The film's main appeal, the action, was not enough to redeem it in the slightest. Too over the top and CGI dependent, it just came across as silly and completely unbelievable (and I'm not meaning, 'suspension of disbelief' unbelievable, I'm talking just plain stupid)

The obligatory 'good guys almost lose, but win in the end' plot points were painful to watch, and did not manage to create a sense of suspense in the slightest. The 'romance' between Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez was excruciating to experience, as was much of the cliché dialogue. The only tolerable performances came from Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson (with Gibson managing to offer *some* comedic relief). It is difficult to decide who gave the poorest performance; Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson (the latter, I am fairly certain pronounced 'cavalry' as 'calvary', a word with a completely different meaning). Kurt Russell's appearance was downright sad. The one-liners seemed almost like satire.

The montage of Paul Walker at the end was endearing, but it is ultimately sad that he was associated with such a poor film. There did seem to be some real emotion from the other cast members in the final scene, but it was unfortunately overshadowed by the long, excruciating, ridiculous film that preceded it.

As of the 7th of April, this title is rated 8.2 on IMDb. I cannot understand how anyone can honestly claim that this is a good film.",4
Furious 7,"Finally got around to see this one and man, what a drag. This movie is so silly its not even funny, sure there are some scenes that are exciting, lots of ass and 'splosions, but you really have to switch off your brain. Plus there is definitely too little Rock in it. The Rock was the one that made F&F reasonably fun in the last 2 movies, they literally striped him to a bed for the whole film, what a waist.

The whole memory loss thing was a bit odd to me, it kinda didn't make any sense and was pretty pointless to the movie. Then you have the crew go around the world to find a gizmo to find the Shaw, Shaw shows up but you still worried about the gizmo. The whole plot made absolutely no sense, it was distracting when Shaw appeared 3 freaking times in the location where you are trying to grab a thingymagic to find Shaw. WTF?? Not going to mention the silly action, I agree that if these were set up as superheroes I would mind less, but not a big deal. Nice touch at the end with homage to Walker. But yeah, F&F7 is on par with Transformers 4.",4
Furious 7,"It's really getting old when the bad guy is somehow one step ahead or right behind. In this case, Shaw somehow finds the team around the world more than once, and is in contact with other scumbags. He has unlimited funds, weapons, vehicles, intel, and balls. It's a good thing people like this only exist on screen.

The American black ops team is shown as the sloppiest and most unprepared team on Earth.

Of course, it's the seventh installment of this goofy franchise and it's more like a dream than a movie.

Have a few drinks, and you will enjoy it.",4
Furious 7,"Giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours. The participants are all made of rubber, shaking off injuries that would kill a rhino and performing literal superhuman feats. These scenes make no sense whatsoever, but damn if they aren't entertaining beyond belief.

Of course, the writing is pretty bad at times, almost nonsensical. It's replete with corny one-liners that would make Schwarzenegger blush, and much of the dialogue itself is cringe-worthy. As the movies have gotten bigger, so have the casts, and this film is no different. We have the equivalent of guest stars in this film with people like Tony Jaa playing a lethal terrorist and Rhonda Rousey playing the head of the Charlie's Angels type security team in Abu Dhabi. Jaa holds his own, but Rousey is such a godawful actress, she can barely belch out her three or four words before she does what she does best, which is go toe-to-toe with Michelle Rodriguez in a girlfight. (Say what you want to about Gina Carano in ""Fast & Furious 6,"" but she's Oscar-caliber compared to Rousey's stupefied delivery.)",4
Furious 7,"""It is soooo good! Oh my god you will cry at the end! Such a good film, Paul Walker was amazing!""

...are all I seem to be hearing about this film, which I reluctantly went to see. Meh, I thought, a it'll be some mindless violence and if people are raving about it, perhaps it will be better than I expect...

...It wasn't.

Fans of the films are going to love it either way. Everyone else will be divided by either how gullible they are, how much they enjoy mindless action, and how humorous they find things.

Don't me wrong, I absolutely love mindless action movies, But the thing for me with this movie, is that it's not actually clear if they are taking the film seriously. I know, obviously it's not meant to be realistic, but if they aren't taking it too seriously then they do a bad job of showing it.

Usually in decent action films, the characters sometimes reference how out of control a situation is. Even if it's just a ""woah that's crazy"" or Take Bad Boy's II for example. They had cars thrown at them during the chase scene, but it was OK because the characters acknowledged that it was not a normal thing to be happening ""They're throwing cars at us Marcus, how am I not seeing that!?"" With Furious 7, not a single character seemed to realise what they were doing was complete and utter bonkers. (It still baffles me how they can drive a car through three skyscrapers and everyone just acts as if it's no biggie).

And oh the cheese! In the end I spent more time laughing out loud at the films ridiculousness, than actually really even enjoying it.

This film oozes with cheesy dialogue, cheesy clichés and cheesy performances.

The nail in the ol coffin even came pretty early on when they jumped the shark with Statham and Diesel crashing their cars head on to each other and getting out with a scratch. From there, I couldn't take anything they did at all seriously. Everything was laughable, even the obviously supposed 'dramatic' parts such as the aftermath of Vin Diesel pulling a 'Die Hard' and trying to take down a helicopter with a car.

At least JohnMcClain had the sensibility to get out of the car first.

Plot wise, trying to make it anything more than a revenge film, just made it a mess. In some parts, it even felt like watching cut scenes from a game.

Annnnd now onto the Paul Walker send off. Personally I thought it was OK, kinda cheesy, and didn't stir up any emotions. (For me his best role was in Running Scared, so his character in this was 'meh' to me.)

They did do well making a film with one of the main cast passing during shooting, however it was just not a good film. And I refuse to give it praise just because it was Paul Walkers last film. A bad film is a bad film.

In the end I give it a 4, but more like a 5 just sheerly because I really did enjoy laughing at it.",4
Jurassic World,"Jurassic Park was cutting edge, it looked real had top of the line special effects, enjoyable characters, interesting storyline whereas this new version has cartoon dinosaurs. CGI is cartoons drawn with computers, as it becomes more available it looks more generic and cheap. A real shot of and animal or person running through the woods the light and shadows on the animal or human would change, in this movie it doesn't. Most of the cgi dinosaurs have little to no color variation over their body and very little to no shadows with any of the dinosaurs in any scene. The dinosaurs really are cartoon in this movie. Chris Pratt is a supporting actor at best, he has little emotion in face body language or tone of voice. He has little to no personality. I am still trying to figure out how him being in the navy makes him an expert animal trainer. Nearly every character in this movie is self absorbed and arrogant, not sad when they get eaten. I'm short the dinosaurs are not realistic, the characters are irritating and the storyline eh it ripped off this Jurassic Park.",1
Jurassic World,"I really did the best I could, but I had a hard time not falling asleep or getting bored to death during this film. Truly a total waste of time and money.",1
Jurassic World,"CRAP!!! Does not even deserve a 1 star! So much hype and this is what we got! Who are these jokers giving this a 10? This movie is nowhere a 7/10 movie, that's a joke!",1
Jurassic World,Do you like ads? Watch this movie. Do you like the classic Jurassic Park movies? Don't watch this movie.,1
Jurassic World,I was desperately waiting for this movie to end. It has nothing to do with jurassik park and won't give you any feelings of sympathy or thrill over the entire duration. It's full of inconsistency which can't let you dive into the story.,1
Jurassic World,"The movie would have been much better if the idea behind it was different...

The whole idea of making a dinosaur park out of mixing of other dino's is not what a dino park is about, you can't open a zoo where you mix half cat/half dog and call it a zoo.

not to mention the idea of engineering a super killing machine, all stupid, I hated the movie but I even hate more the idea of the ""people"" (the story people) who think can do such a park.

also, suppose the park administration need to have an aviary dino's variety, create 10-15 flying dino's not 200 and put them in a glass cage !!!

I can't express the many ways I didn't like this movie !!!!",1
Jurassic World,"I mistook Jaws 3 for this movie before deciding, upon further inspection this movie is just a ripoff of Jaws 3. Can't believe you thought no one would ever notice. Sad.

Next time ripoff a movie that isn't trash. Next time start with a film that's good cause if you're going to start with a bad movie, it's not just gonna become a good movie cause you put some special effects on it and reskinned it to be dinosaurs not sharks. If it were underwater, I bet you'd be called on copyright infringement. If held at gunpoint and asked to watch Jurassic World or Jaws 3, I'd first ask to be shot, but then I'd probably watch Jaws 3, and that should make you consider either a different choice in the future, or a different career path.",1
Jurassic World,"I cannot believe this movie scores a 7, especially with a plethora of the most caustic comments you can imagine from folks who agree that this remake is weak beyond words. I have managed to skip Jurassic mania as I sensed it was a bunch of hype but upon seeing trailer for JW2 I became interested (as Chris Pratt as Starlord is amusing as hell). Then I put the DVR on and sat back to find out what all the excitement was about as it must be good to make a sequel to a sequel and theme parks and such. I was mistaken, and I wasn't entirely sure when the feeling hit me that this is a steaming pile of raptor remains, but it was pretty close to when the bigger clueless guard gets munched in one bite, our ""heroes"" escape the plastic orb of doom or Lena Luthor (didn't catch name or her importance in the movie , kind of like the owner who had copter flying issues) being tossed about by pterodactyls (like they wouldn't just fly away) like a frisbee while our ""heroes"" stand around trying to figure out what to do next, or making out for no apparent reason. Stopped there, may not return as I figured military dude will get in a showdown trying to stop Rex and all his men will get their ass kicked till Chris Pine and high heeled partner w kids she doesn't know the heights of fashion a grenade launcher out of spare jeep parts from 20 years ago and save the day. Can't even believe anyone could mention Jurassic anything in the same sentence as The Incredibles I or II as there is no comparison. The ending credits for Incredibles is more entertaining than this POC and if we can somehow dissuade just one person from carrying on the fantasy that this franchise is worthy of anyones time or $$ then this will be worthwhile.",1
Jurassic World,What an absolute shambles that was. After 20 minutes I was bored to tears and despite watching the full movie I found it was only to get even worse. How the studio justified a sequel Is beyond me. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.,1
Jurassic World,"PLEASE NOTE: I don't consider any of these spoilers; what's below is the kind of thing you might see in a trailer. But if you want to be extra careful, I guess stop here.

I almost never write movie reviews, but this film made me so angry that I have to say something. If all I do is prevent one person from wasting a penny on it, I will be happy. Why? Well, this may be one of the most misogynistic movies I have ever seen. It is so insulting to women that I am blown away it was made today and not 75 years ago. Yes, it's an adventure flick; I suppose we're just supposed to take it as it is – a silly blockbuster – and not read too much into anything. But it was so glaringly awful that I almost couldn't finish.

Claire is the butt of almost every joke. She's portrayed as some kind of emotionless, control-freak ice queen and the movie is going to teach her a lesson aboutwhat? Being more nurturing and feminine I guess? Rather than going on and on, let me just give a few examples of what I mean.

1. At the beginning of the movie, Claire's big boss and the owner of the park comes to visit so she's unable to spend the day with her nephews because, you know, she has to meet with her boss. One of her nephews looks like she just kicked a puppy, even though she promises to take the entire next day off and give them a backstage tour. Then her sister calls actually in tears because Claire is neglecting her nephews in what was supposed to be a family vacation. From work. She calls from work to chastise her sister for having to work, even though she and her husband didn't take time off to go with them on this so-called ""family"" vacation.

2. When her nephews go missing, she turns to Big Tough-But-Sensitive Hero (BTBSH) for help. He asks how old they are, and she says one is in high school and the other is a few years younger. He's incredulous that she doesn't know her nephews' precise ages. There is a MAN-EATING MONSTER on the loose, this woman is terrified for her missing nephews, and he's criticizing her for, in a moment of panic, not knowing exactly old her nephews are?! I would think knowing one is in high school and the other is a few years younger is plenty enough information! But no. Because she is a horrible woman.

3. Both BTBSH and Claire (but mostly BTBSH) save the kids on several occasions, and after one incident, they ask to stay with ""you."" Claire passionately promises she'll never leave them again, and they reply: ""No him. We want to stay with him."" Ha ha? I justI can't. I can't.

I could come up with plenty more moments like this but I won't. And what makes this especially sad is that in the first Jurassic Park, way back in 1992, the main female character was this, great, strong, competent woman, who doesn't need saving any more than anyone else (unlike Claire). And the girl (there's a brother and sister in that one) is also smart and brave and even plays a major role in saving the day. This time, the only girl with a speaking role is the older boy's mooning, clingy girlfriend who begs him to send a selfie every day because she'll miss him so much. Whereupon he promptly goes off and eyes every girl he sees at the park. Boys will be boys?

It makes me want to cry that there are people in this day and age who would write this kind of offensive sludge and think it's funny. I want that two hours of my life back.",1
Jurassic World,"I don't know where to start. Everything in this mlvie is awful. The maverick wearing a Han Solo vest, the incompetent and irrational CEO, the security who cannot secure themselves, nothing makes sense in this movie. People are dying, but nobody acts. There is no emrgency training, no worst case scenario.

It is crap!",1
Jurassic World,I was thoroughly disappointed by the fact that there was no banner fall during the end scene like in the first Jurrassic Park. I am a banner enthusiast and only enjoy movies that employ the use of a good banner scene.,1
Jurassic World,"Literally I think I could plug in some cables into a old piece of paper that annoyingly blew its way onto your property or a dirty moldy pop can and have more fun trying to play that than endure this painful movie.

I was feeling all kinds of things like leg cramps, leg dryness (hard to explain what that is, it's not a skin thing), lack of blood flow in me, dizzy feelings that tingle in the thigh when I was watching this. It's like, imagine you have a flow of energy in a circuit. If you like disrupt it, then the flow doesn't work right? We have a flow that is satisfied by the movies we watch, and when that flow SUCKS, our bodies begin to shut down because they're not working circuits. Your legs keep fidgeting because you're bored, your breathing becomes difficult, all in all it felt crap to see this. Makes me wonder if you can even hold them responsible for making such atrocious cinema, because seriously I even had stomach problems after seeing it.

Or maybe that's because I see too much Jurassic Park in youth and was let down so I got like sick or something...but anyway! Know that I'm one of the biggest fans ever to exist of Jurassic Park. I had all the cool toys, everything. Charts showing the dinosaur sizes, video games, and all from the cool era back then. None of this J world filth. Real old school Lost World and JP3 stuff. So if there were anyone to have review this movie, it's me (and of course the other fans out there too).

It sucked right from beginning to end, the dinosaurs are reduced to annoying playthings, like literally it's not like ""oh that raptor is scary"", it's more like ""that raptor is annoying, like that kid who keeps going number two on your lawn"". It all reeks of annoying things. It's sad, it's not even like it's disturbing like Saw or Texas Chainsaw Massacre or something, it's just annoying.

Dinos are not these creatures you can turn into graphic barbie showcase things with the ugly kids riding them and ugly kids going to see them in a park. They're noble beings, full of power and majesty. LISTEN TO JOHN HAMMOND AND MALCOLM IN THE 2ND MOVIE FOR Christ SAKES, the creatures need our ABSENCE, and that includes the makers in our world that try to make (*cough* steal 1990's filmmakers ideas) stories and CG models out of them. They all look like they've been animated by selfish people, a loving CG artist makes even the cruddiest of 3D modelia shine with life. It's just a matter of a simple loving touch, that's what makes CG great (I know from some experience with CG). This movie had none of that. So sorry, the dinosaurs don't make you drool with immense urges to draw and colour them in all day, to have complex dioramas with your toys, it makes it worse than a street dog in your head. Just some ""oh look tommy, there's an annoying dino, go pet him"".

Our dinos before had vicious survival based lives and they were as great as seeing your own mother and father when they came on screen. They marched in and ran the show, they were precious. The roars still fill my ears when I sleep at night.

All the intro garbage crap with the kids and the dumb texting girlfriend nonsense, you put that in a kids movie? Seriously? That's when you know never to trust ANYTHING from this film company again, they're frauds. There was even a VERY big hint at a nude subject in the movie which I won't dare discuss. People are swearing left and right, like jeez you think the small words aren't swear words? You think our beloved Jurassic trilogy has language like that? You clearly don't know what a kid friendly movie is. Don't take your kids to see this, it's not worth it.

The dinosaurs are all trying too hard to be cool, and YES I do treat the dinosaurs as their own creatures even through the screen because they were amazing enough to receive that treatment in the 3 movies. All the personifying of the dinos making them into more things for humans to control is annoying. Like a dinosaur movie isn't about them helping each other beat the bad dino like humans would, these makers are trying to make them like humans. These animals work alone and look like REAL animals when they think. YES, they can be friends but it has a different feel. It felt more like pixar creature love than anything. Complete disgrace to what keyboard and mouse is meant for. All the CG programs have been disgraced by this. The music blew too.

-10000/10 if I could, but sadly 1 is the lowest rating the website permisses.",1
Jurassic World,"This was the most disappointing film of all time in my opinion. Jurassic fans like myself have waiting for the perfect fourth installment of the Jurassic franchise to come after Jurassic Park 3. And when it was announced in 2012 that the fourth installment was titled Jurassic World, we all lost our minds. And some people genuinely enjoyed this film, and viewed this as an enjoyable and a popcorn movie, and an action packed film with dinosaurs in the middle of it. In Other words, it was a fast and furious film with dinosaurs in the middle of it. While others like my self saw this as an utter disappointment to the franchise. My head was hung way too low after I saw this film. And this is this is how I would chose to rewrite the film:

The story follows a fully functional park in the distant but near future, as a strange man who works for Bio Sin, Ingen's rival (Ingen is the company that runs Jurassic park and Jurassic world) shuts down all systems in the park, leaving it with no power, no electricity, complete darkness, loose dinosaurs, a completely shut down Jurassic World. This would leave quite a scary, dark, and horrific setting for the characters to face.

Make this film the first rated r film of the franchise. A PG 13 film could be released alongside for kids to watch. But the real movie is rated r. Meaning full on gore and blood and violence. So decapitated heads, limbs, bloody carcase, etc. There are also some Horror elements implemented too. Many stunning horror scenes could be shot especially with the raptors. This will be the first movie where children characters in this film die.

One horror scene would include an Ingen Soldier in a dark hallway, he lights a flare to see where to go. But as he walks he hears a suttle snarl or growl if you will. And as he looks around to see what's going on, he looks up slowly and and sees a velociraptor up on a vent in the ceiling. The soldier pulls out a pistol, aims for the raptor, and shoots. He misses and raptor roars and jumps on him. As the raptor claws his back, the soldier tries to crawl his way out if the hallway, and this is where the gore comes into play. As he drags himself across the floor, he leaves a trail if blood smeared across. The raptor then snaps the soldier's neck with his mouth, and feeds on his intestines.

Keep the previous dinosaur designs from the previous films of the franchise. One of the most disappointing things about the whole film was its cartoony and fake dinosaur designs. The completely changed Rexy's appearance, the raptors look disgusting and outlandish, the pteranodons look like pigeons with crests, and the stegosaurs look like they got ripped from the pages of a dinosaur book in the 1960s. Rexy's design should stay true to how she looked in Jurassic Park. The Velociraptors should keep their Jurassic Park 3 designs, but change they're colours to differentiate between the Jurassic World and Jurassic Park designs, and the Male Raptors should have more feathers. The pteranodons should keep they're Lost World or Jurassic Park 3 designs, although I prefer the Jurassic Park 3 designs as they look more menacing but The Lost World designs look good too. And finally the stegos should keep The Lost World designs exactly the same unchanged.

The visual effects should be delt with the same way they were delt with in the original Jurassic Park. Jurassic World had one of the most cartoony and fake CGI ever in my opinion. The original Jurassic Park that came out in 1993 had one of the most stunning CGI shots in all of cinema history. We live in an era of technology, this should not happen. This Jurassic World should be done the same way Jurassic Park was. Stan Winston animatronics and puppets for close ups, and CGI for wide shots.

Characters include Owen Grady but not a raptor trainer (we are not going the military dinosaur route at all) Tim Murphay, Lex Murphay, Tim's children and Lex's children, Simon Hammond whi is John Hammond's son (John hammond created the first Jurassic Park) Ian Malcom and Ellie Satler and Alan Grabt although they won't be on Isla Nublar.

The Park will include a large futuristic Visitor's Center, not like the one in Jurassic World, a pachycephalosurus fighting arena, two separate Rex enclosures, one that includes Rexy, and another that includes a feathered T-Rex, a Raptor family pen, and aviary with Pteranodons and Ramphyrincus, a carnotaurus forest, a dilophosaurus pen showcasing hunting shows of them hunting down cows and goats, Baryonix and Suchomimus River, a large herbivore valley which includes Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, Pachyrinosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Diplodocus, Iguanadon, Stegosaurs, Kentrosaurus, and many more. Other enclosures include Spinosaurs Lake, the aquarium which includes creatures like Leoplorodon, plesiosaurus, elasmosaurus, etc. Transports around the park include advanced Jeeps for the rangers, a much larger monorail, a submarine ride around the aquarium with non carnivorous creatures, and ranger car tours around the herbivore valley, and a large transport in the gallimimus herd.

This is how I would rewrite Jurassic World. In my opinion this would make for a more compelling and stunning story. I believe the audience would be at the edge of their seats, and frightened when watching this.",1
Jurassic World,"Its like the old saying goes. If its not broken don't fix it. Nothing will ever beat the original. They need to leave this franchise alone. The entire story line of Owen (chris Pratt) being some kind of velociraptor whisperer is so cheesy. They are trying to make the velociraptor into some kind of pet dog you can train. Who ever is Chris Pratts manager should get paid almost as much as him, because all i see when i look at him is the goofy guy from parks and rec, not a dino trainer, how he got this gig blows my mind, congrats.",1
Jurassic World,"Btw, every person reviewing this movie should be mind blown that the imbd staff rated this movie a 7.2. Please tell me i'm not the only person that thinks they are getting checks from chris pratt himself. i mean only 48 staff members voted, either they are getting paid to raise this rating or i should be a staff member because there's a large group of people that suck at their job.",1
Jurassic World,"This movie has it all: forced straight romance, cheap charater deaths to get the audience emotional with cheap writing, plot devices that make zero sense in context, and so fourth. they give the main dinosaur all kinds of genetic splicing abilities that, while badass, go counter to its purpose as a zoo exhibit. things get out of control simply because it is expected, not because it makes sense in the story. and the cherry on top, the ending. the movie ends with a huge spectacle that goes against everything we've come to understand of the creatures. could a movie be worse? absolutely! but that does not change the fact that this movie is plain bad.",1
Jurassic World,Would give 1000/0 but the end credits dont have the good song,1
Jurassic World,"The whole story seems very unlikely and lacks basic logic, from the beginning. I mean, why would someone create a huge invincible predator with a+ camouflage skills for entertaining purposes? I could understand that people would lose interest in ""regular"" dinosaurs after a certain amount of time, but no man in their right mind would come up with this solution in the real world.

The army angle was textbook cliché, nothing new there, but the end scene, where the girl races the T-Rex in high heels really got me... just wow. I remember people laughing harder at this scene, than at any jokes in the movie.

The love interest between the two protagonists seemed a bit awkward and forced. The same could be said about some of the dialogues.

The visual effects on the other hand were flawless throughout the whole movie, but that's to be expected from a big studio picture. All in all, it looked great, but it didn't make me >feel< anything. I probably would't watch it again. Maybe without sound. With a cutout moustache taped to the screen. For fun.",1
Jurassic World,"You can't replace acting with high technology special effects. Selection of actors for this movie was horrible, worst acting ever. I watched a lot of stupid movies all the way through but this one I couldn't. American humor is just ridiculous, They screw it up BIG with this movie",1
Jurassic World,"Colin Trevorrow is touted to be able to do it all- count to infinity, can find corners in circles, out-Speilberged Spielberg, has played Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun and won etc. But one thing he clearly cannot do is to ensure that every film of his entertains. Jurassic World may boast of all that motion capture technology, but put side by side Bollywood exploits such as Kochadaiiyaan, it comes off as an amateurish, cartoonish effort.

Pratt is virtually in every frame of the film, and as usual he oozes style and confidence. While the movie is decently paced, every scene is either some human drama or a non-dino sequence. The result of the motion capture technology is abysmal. The reason for doing motion capture is to impart real feel to animated characters. In Jurassic World, the effect is opposite- there is no real emotion in the facial shots of the dinos. Had it been a live action film, it might have looked good. But today's audience used to Avatar and its ilk, this mediocre effort simply does not cut the cake. Even Cars 2 features better animation! The whole mess is rather dreary. It maintains no consistent tone aside from rushed desperation. This is nothing like the colorful silliness the Japanese monster movies are famous for.

This expensive experiment to immortalize our reptilian brethren might be good enough for die hard fans, but still cannot make up for its complete lack of connect, and its technical shortcomings. The last scene indicated a sequel and more product placements from ecco-friendly coporations- hope that is done better. 3/10",1
Jurassic World,"I remember as a kid, my parent taking me to see Jurassic Park.Everybody was raving so much about it, I just couldn't wait to see it.Watching it in the theater I was BORED out of mind.I remember squirming in my seat just waiting for it to be over.Now here comes...... Jurassic World.It wasn't on my Must See list but I had the chance to watch it for free so why not? I was hoping that maybe I'd like it more than I liked Jurassic Park but it felt like Deja Vu all over again.Starting out I was full of hope but as the movie went on I noticed I started losing attention.I had to rewind certain parts over & over again just to see what I missed.With about 30+ minutes left, I was ready to give up but I stuck it through because it almost over anyways.Just like with Jurassic Park I was BORED out of my mind.The nicest thing I can say about Jurassic World was the special effects were cool (I guess) After the movie was over I nodded right off for 10-15 minutes.Jurassic World was 2 hours, too long.In 2018, Jurassic World 2 is coming out & If I can see it for free, I'll be torturing myself all over again",1
Jurassic World,"They somehow managed to make dinosaurs look boring. And the plot even worse than anything seen before in the franchise. The only constant is the pseudo-philosophical nonsense that reviving dinosaurs was bound to bring destruction, because humans are just too dumb to run a zoo. Well, when you write your characters as complete morons, I guess that is the inevitable result. This film is so dumb, it insults intelligence. And it's boring. It even says in the movie that people are bored of dinosaurs. I don't know if they detected the irony. If you can't make dinosaurs interesting, don't make movies.",1
Jurassic World,"This is the worst movie of 2015 by far. I have watched over 1k of movies all added on IMDb and this is the first review i have written.

Such a fan of the original franchise all 3 movies were good, this film is blockbuster rubbish at its finest.

All made for money, rubbish acting, rubbish story line. The end is shocking it anger me beyond believe.

STORY LINE - Freak DNA monster created (Like that story line has not been done before)

Escapes, kills everything, and dies.

And wait..... the ending is amazing.

Bring back the power ranger teaming up & tag team with the other dinosaurs to kill the beast.

Woooooooooooowwww.....

Do not watch this pile of rubbish if i could swear on this site i would.",1
Jurassic World,"Jurassic World marks the triumphant return of the Jurassic Park series to the big screen after following a fourteen year absence, and mostly it just reminded me of why I haven't really been yearning for another Jurassic Park sequel in that time. Seeing the commercials I expected a big, dumb, fun movie. The dumb was plentiful, the big felt lacking, and the fun sparse. Sadly, watching Jurassic World seemed to disapprove the presumption I based my ticket purchase on, which was it must be a marked improvement over the previous two Jurassic Park movies.

Ignoring the many script problems, Jurassic World's biggest failing is it just didn't pack much wow factor for me. There's little craft in introducing the audience to what's both the film's and park's main attractions. With dinosaurs simply being there with no attempts to build tension and characters in the film constantly repeating how they're no longer exciting, which feels less like a joke and more like an admission of failure as even after everything inevitably goes wrong, there's still not much to get excited about.

Even the trailer's much hyped super beast, the Indominus rex, appears to us clearly in broad daylight with little fanfare as just a T-Rex with raptor arms painted a dull gray and devoid of any of the charm or personality of either dinosaur it's loosely based on. And even the reintroduction of those classic carnivores pales in comparison to their original reveals. There's no real build up like the famous slow unveil of the T-Rex from the original film, or the tension the Velociraptors created from quickly and methodically tracking its prey.

Other dinos fair no better as they're largely just window dressing in the background, beneath introductions or any significant screen time outside of generic hazards, such as the flying dinosaurs who escape the aviary, only to randomly attack and breaks things for a while before simply disappearing from the film. I'm not a fan of The Lost World or JP III, but the former did have an effective top down shot of the hapless humans being surrounded by raptors as they crept silently through the tall grass to their clueless prey, and the later featured a fairly memorable unveiling of the pteranodon as it sulked out of the fog while walking on its wing tips, giving it an oddly alien look.

The lone exception and one of Jurassic World's few saving graces is the mighty mosasaur, who even in the context of the film, inspires awe from the otherwise jaded older brother character, and whose incredible scope was featured prominently on one of the movie's posters. The mosasaur steals all three scenes it's in, ultimately upstaging the film's cast, human or otherwise, in its final appearance, and all with probably only a combined minute of screen time. By contrast, the Indominus rex never rises above something akin to an unmemorable boss from a video game, and whose intelligence and abilities amount to little more than it simply shrugging off attacks.

Weighing down the fairly unremarkable novelty factor is the story, which suffers from an overabundance of undeveloped ideas as well an unneeded focus on the script's weakest elements. There's some interesting potential in possible parallels between the park and Sea World or a crazy military character wanting to use dinosaurs to win wars. But a large portion of the first thirty minutes, as well more scenes in the later acts, are devoted to the park's business workings, establishing the little brother likes dinosaurs while the older one doesn't care, and how Bryce Dallas Howard's character doesn't pay enough attention to her nephews.

Howard's character in particular has an absurd amount of scenes focused on her subplot involving her sister's kids. With the boys' mother calling her at one point to literally cry about her neglect of them just in time for said boys to be stranded somewhere in the park so she can race to them in her pristine Mercedes and repeatedly stress to Chris Pratt just how hard she's going to rescue them. It's very reminiscent of the previous sequels insistence on using cheap family melodrama to pad for time, and fails to achieve the first film's more subdued approach, where Dr. Grant's dislike of children is covered in a few amusing scenes and is resolved by showing him tenderly holding Lex and Tim after the three had to endure hell together all movie.

A lot of plot points and characters are dropped or even completely forgotten, and sometimes even contradict each other. One plot ""twist"" is that the Indominus can communicate with raptors comes long after a scene where Chris Pratt tells the audience that animals raised in isolation don't develop social skills and can't communicate because they have nothing at all to communicate with or learn from. Then Pratt's commanding officer insists dinosaurs are the future of military missions, after attempting to use them in this fashion backfired hilariously and resulted in almost everything dead, except the one thing they were trying to kill.

Surprisingly the whole dinosaur whisperer thing is actually handled relatively well. The movie depicts him realistically as a trainer of dangerous animals, who develops a relationship and trust with the animals, but doesn't command them. Sadly, the only pay off for this is for the finale where the raptors' loyalty to Pratt turns them back to the human side of the force just in time for the big dumb dinosaur fight that makes up the climax.

It's not worth nitpicking Jurassic World to death though, because ultimately it's not a terrible film, just sub-par, which sadly puts it in the same place as The Lost World and Jurassic Park III for me. Unlike those movies, Jurassic World did have some fresh ideas mixed in, but it never seemed to realize how to exploit them and ultimately is just an inoffensive but forgettable summer popcorn flick.",2
Jurassic World,"Let's start right off with the spoiler: There is a dinosaur park on an island, the containment system breaks down, dinosaurs get out, people get eaten (including some bad guys). Wait. Didn't I just describe the original Jurassic Park and more or less all the others? Yup, sure did. There is nothing, NOTHING, original in this film except a few negligible tweaks on previous Jurassic plots.

What sets this one apart is the new low in the dialog and the acting. The dialog is idiotic beyond description. Routine, silly, predictable, overdone, ... Wait. I'm giving it too much credit because I said beyond description, so let's leave it at that: beyond description. The acting ranges from nothing special to terrible. The prize for most terrible goes to Bryce Dallas Howard, who cannot act to save her life. She seems to think that routine swagger and pre-teen gestures convey character and emotion. She cannot even pronounce standard English: ""Walcome to Jurassic World,"" ""year over year ravenue continues to build,"" ""higher than aver,"" ""our DNA axcavators discover new species avery year,"" ""learned more from genatics in the past dacade than a santury of digging up bones,"" ""the Indominus rax,"" just to take examples from the first 10 minutes of her appearance on screen.

Despite all its flaws, the movie provides an amusing diversion if you are tired and just want to park yourself in front of the tube or your monitor and be entertained by brainless, predictable action. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1.",2
Jurassic World,"Some technical aspects of the movie were particularly well fulfilled. The beauty of the sceneries, these drone like captions which were quite impressive and the rendering the dinosaurs is actually very well done and quite realistic. I tried to watch to movie without making reference to the past Jurassic parks and decided to handle it as an innovative product. Needless to say that I was deceived.

The build up to the interesting part of the movie takes way too much time. This got me particularly bored for a good section. And when came the action scenes, I must admit that they were impressive even if you could read the story and the finale before the movie had even started. Something which brings me to the second point.

I actually got also bored very quickly with the story which turned out to be particularly predictable and generic. You'll find all the classic action movie cliché. So I'll not be saying anything precise on that aspect.

However, the most annoying element was the music during the different scenes like a way to force the spectator to feel or react in a certain way. I found those to be particularly tacky, invasive and annoying most of the times. Action movies should leave to the spectator a certain degree of liberty with his feelings. Most of the action scenes were already quite impressive and did not require this useless addition.

I found some of the acting to be particularly bad. Anyways, as far as certain characters go. Bryce Dallas Howard was not particularly convincing in the role of a boss and neither was she convincing in the role of a ""Tomb Raider"" like adventuress and neither was she convincing in a more emotional role. In resumé, I found her to be quite useless when she was painted as the main character to lead the movie with Pratt.

Add to the fact that she was running in a forest all throughout or running away from dinosaurs like Usain Bolt in high heels without them breaking ever. I mean, any woman that would realistically do that would have her feet completely bummed. That alone just does not make sense at all.

Even when she tried to revolt, she just did not seem all that credible. The law and order cast was kind of surprising -- and, Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio actually played his role quite well since I was only really accustomed with him in the series. BD Wong though was probably a little less convincing. He does not seem to have a huge acting palette (though I would have to see him in other movies).

Finally, Omar Sy, this was a difficult movie for him. He's a very good actor in that comic type of role and this one did not have a lot of space for him to express his talent. I found him to be particularly invisible and relegated to some sort of cheap 5th hand role when he could do and be much better than that.

I really wanted to see this movie but I can't help but feel after watching it a sentiment of bore. Hence the 2/10.",2
Jurassic World,"Spoiler alert people! Yes, dinosaurs are finally back! However, Jurassic World completely misses the point. Why did we all love the old movies? They were mysterious, a bit scary and we knew the dinosaurs do not at any point have ""feelings"" in the same term as a human.

At the end, when the giant modified dinosaur dies, the T-Rex just looks at his human companions.. as if they are friends now, and he did them a big favor. Let us now just run along and be happy we are both alive, I won't eat you. Why? The movie is supposed to be brutal, and scary, but at the same time have an adventurous feeling to it. I almost.. just almost.. think this movie was as terrible as the third one.

And by the way.. bring back Jeff, at least he made the movies funny by thinking what we were all thinking... ""you idiots, why did you ever decide to create a living dinosaur that can eat you?!"".

I miss the times when Steven Spielberg would direct movies like this.. at least he knew what the audience wants. The next time I will wait until at least a few weeks to see if I am even going to approach this series of movies again.

The only highlight was Chris Pratt.. at least he had a nice role to play, and his acting is good.. same with that woman I completely forgot who was, her acting was good, her role sucked.",2
Jurassic World,None of the charm of the classic. Just a CGI bore fest,2
Jurassic World,"Graphics and don' t really care about logic, go see it - you'll love it. If not, just don't.. ignore. I tried to like it, I honestly did. Yet, the story has so many holes and it turns out into such a cliche, that has been seen for so many times now. To cut a long story short - if you like killing time, go see it. If you appreciate your time, never watch this freaking movie",2
Jurassic World,Review: I was disappointed with this movie because I expected a hell of a lot more from a Jurassic park based movie. The direction and screenplay are both sub-par. The casting and acting wasn't bad. Chris Pratt gave a stand alone good performance as an adult version of Owen the little boy from the original Jurassic park. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.,2
Jurassic World,"Awful acting, awful plot, awful script. As lazy and insulting a film as you could get. Only for real thickos and 6 year olds.",2
Jurassic World,Absolutely Boring Didn't Like this one at all it was very disappointing,2
Jurassic World,"I knew it was going to be less compared to the originals (yes Im a fan of all 3 Jurassic Park movies) since Spielberg is absent, but this one was way too bad. ""Bubblegum movie"", you chew it and spit it out - not a classic.

All i remember from the movie is Starbucks, Pandora, Mercedes, and i hate at least the first 2. These movies of the new age care more about marketing than the movie itself, the plot, the characters etc. As many one star reviews already pointed out, this movie lacked in every department. Many useless scenes and things that don't make sense. And if you have to feature a pretty redhead in heels and a sexy guy to make it interesting, your game is weak. As a redhead myself her copper hair was the most interesting thing in the movie. BUT everything felt incomplete even the romance added. I told my mother who wanted to see it ""you wont be scared at all, you wont hold your breath, no suspense"". ""Action"" seems to start very early in the movie but randomly and every scene gets watered down and the movie is in a hurry to go back to nerdy good old normal. Actors are too cold, too apathetic esp the ones in the computers room. Seems like they were forced to add some mild drama moments for old times' sake. Fast paced, no mystery, no anticipation, no fear, no escalation; so flat, ""safe"" and predictable - with scattered random mediocre short action scenes(for an impressive trailer), and the main focus is always the well lit view of the various brands they advertised. Technology at your feet but 0 inspiration. From a gadget addicted generation to the gadget addicted young viewers (the boy trying to make the other one get off his phone) - if you grew up in the 90s you know what i mean. They dare to threaten us with a sequel. If you held your breath with the raptors in the kitchen room and the jello trembling, and if you felt like the one being chased, then you demand something more!! If i were Mr. Trevorrow id be ashamed to name it after the originals. Buut one more reason to watch the good old ones again ;)",2
Jurassic World,"This movie was so stupid, you would swear that it was directed by Michael Bay or Jar Jar Abrams, the type of Hollywood jerk who never seems to go away, even after beating franchises like Star Trek and Star Wars to death.

The plot is a totally original. Somehow, yet another Jurassic Park exists with no explanation of where it came from and the main characters once again travel to the island only to find themselves running from the dinosaurs later to escape from being eaten... Brilliant.

The director, Colin Trevorrow is now slated to write and direct Episode 9, no doubt ending that franchise on a low note. The characters in this movie are so vapid and one-dimensional, you will find yourself rooting for the dinosaurs, hoping they will kill lots of people in some grandiose fashion like in the previous installments. It tries to be suspenseful, but fails miserably. Chris Pratt, who was terrific in Guardians of the Galaxy looks totally out of place in this one, displaying the same idiotic expression on his face throughout the entire film that never changes. This movie is far worse than The Lost World and that's saying something.",2
Jurassic World,"This movie is so bad on so many levels.

First, the overuse of CGI makes this a very bad movie not to mention that the plot is just stupid. This is nothing more than a 'final destination' type film. It has no chemistry, no story and worse, did they not realize that music is a character in the film? As for the kids in the film, I kept hoping the dinosaurs would eat them almost from the beginning just to spare me from their acting.

You can always tell when Steven Spielberg isn't directly involved in the making of a film.

I would suggest staying away.

Save your money",2
Jurassic World,"This is completely waste of time! So what, you have a computer, you can add effects and the story doesn't matter anymore? Red haired hot chick, muscular guy and a bunch of computer created dinosaurs based on Ice age 3 and How to train your dragon, and you think that is a good movie? I want somebody to return these two wasted hours of my life, or at least buy me a beer and popkorns. It started with annoying classical music, repeated some parts of the first Jurasic movie and included just absurd dinosaur training... Give me some good reason who and why directed and payed this movie to be released! I am sorry but this movie is completely waste of time. I have watched trailer and I decided to give it a chance. What a huge mistake! When you make a better movie call me, till then do not bother. I am sure dinosaurs should be ashamed of the way this movie shows them after all these years.",2
Jurassic World,"I don't have a problem with action movies, I judge them on whether they're entertaining enough to make me forget in the moment how actually ridiculous and overblown they are. Jurassic World fails miserably. The whole deal is predicated on idiocy and over relies on cheap attempts at recreating scenes from the original, as if going with the same score makes up how dimwitted it is and will in and of itself inspire the same wonder. The effects are garbage, nothing ever actually looks like it's happening in the same space. The characters are fairly cardboard and most conversations feel like they're happening in separate spaces. They wait three quarters of the movie to reveal a detail about the Big Bad New Dinosaur that was obvious from the first time they talked about the thing. If you even half paid attention to the original then everything in this one is 100% predictable. Stay home and watch the original since it still holds up.",2
Jurassic World,"I made a mistake watching this movie right after the new Mad Max. Ironically, one of the reasons for which I loved Mad Max Fury Road is the use of the same themes, camera angles and tricks from the old movies. That is also one of the reasons for which I find Jurassic World a terrible film.

Back when I was 12 or so and I went to watch Jurassic Park in the cinema, I fell in love. OK, I was fascinated by dinosaurs back then, and the movie was innovative in more than one way. I even continued to follow the sequels, and liked them enough.

Although I grew up both physically and mentally in these more than 2 decades, unfortunately it seems that the Jurassic Park franchise didn't: they still use the same bad jokes, the same clichés, the same predictability and the same scenes. In this last case, literally: you can actually see some scenes copied from the first movie, perhaps from the other 2 as well. OK, granted, there's not much to do with dinosaurs but to scream, run and hide, although re-using not only stories, plots and sub-plots but scenes themselves with new actors in them is a bit too much. Honestly, at this point, recycling scenes is not an option in what it was a multimillion dollar Hollywood franchise. Let's remember that this is not a remake, but a whole new movie/sequel on its own (presumably).

Apart from that, we get some bad acting (that ""cool"" guy, Owen... Jaysus...). Something the previous movies could boast about was a good cast, generally. I missed some cameo, although I liked the appearance of Dr. Wu (even when they gave him such a miserable part - I guess it's more to add to the lack of charm).

And, why, oh why, do they have to include dinosaurs brawls??? Are these people 12? Hm, perhaps... Maybe some of us got stuck somewhere back there, more than 2 decades ago.

Definitely, a very miss-able movie. Funny how they talk about innovation in it, when the product itself is all but that. One thing they should do, though, is to market those all-purpose high-heels, I'm sure women would appreciate it. I think there's an interesting entry in the msg board about it, along with other ""great"" moments of the film. For all the plot holes, poor acting, repetitive and unimaginative action and so on, I'm extremely surprised and disappointed that Jurassic World has a score of more than 7 here, at the moment.

From now on, I will also be screaming, running and hiding from movies directed by this ""genius"".",2
Jurassic World,"Instead of spending so much money on special effects (that after all are only effects nothing else) spend more time and money in writing a good and descent screenplay. It is just another fast-food movie without any flavor. Some TV shows are far more better. How can the excellent actor Vincent D'Onofrio step in such a trap. I used to enjoy his role in Law & Order. But here he was probably blinded with a nice pay-check, I don't blame him for that. I only hope to see him back in really good movies or TV shows with better stories. In the mean time, check documentaries about Jurassic eras and so on, they are probably much more involving then this bland non-inspiring story.",2
Jurassic World,"That bubble they travel stays on track even when monster trex spin them hard. Than a tiny turn amd they upside down and never spin back no matter what. Trex shake it amd they upside down. Kids out without bang their head or scratch or pull a muscle or whiplash for shaking so hard.

Motorbike in forest ground 40-50miles/hour? Congratulation...

Abanodoned jurassic park scene (come on again?) and that building still not cleared out in 22 years. Dinos roaring and making sounds again without reason. They run and hunt and making sounds. That is not intelligent hunter. (That means the film makers not intelligent)

Birds killing ppl in seconds with poke them. But they not leave with their food. Why not? One of them poke a helicopters widscreen together with that guy in a second but cany poke a human? As we saw on JP3 birds was so clamsy, probably they know main caracters in film should not be hurt.

Raptors communicate wirh that huge mutant trex, and again, human gestures, and stupid sounds. Not professional at all. Probably even Spielbergs grandkids making better sounds when plays with plastic dinos I guess. But why they need to make sound anyway? Just stupid.

And again raptors surrounds them in the end and nothing happen just staring. Big guy walks in just open mouth roaring again aimlessly. ..and one of the raptors ends in flame. (It should be exploded also haha)

And two monsters fights the end, dont understand why (and not communicate in tbis time) Monster ends in the aquarium with giant watermonster. And making sounds again.

That would be the solution to bring the monster straight to the edge of the aquarium instead of put 4 raptors and a Trex in leash.

Friendship between trex and raptor is really stupid, but we see the cherry on top when the Trex roaring in the end, again without reason. (Aquarium idea was way much better)

Its an expensive low brain Hollywood movie again as usual. No brain, without thinking, without reason. But she run high heels in jungle in whole movie.",2
Jurassic World,"I persevered with the film as much as I could and I liked the special effects, but was consistently annoyed with the damn ""shaky cam"" when ever there is an action sequence. Kind of spoils it when you can't see what's going on... Or get dizzy trying.",2
Jurassic World,"Firstly, let's establish that the entire reason this movie currently exists is for Spielberg to continue making gobs of money.

Secondly, let's also establish that the director is waaay out of his depth on this one. Having helmed ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" (which is a solid little indie romcom that I enjoy) it's clear that promoting him so drastically in budget, scale, and material is not something that should have been green lit. But here we are.

This movie relies almost entirely on the nostalgic goodwill of the audience. I'm sure many of the adults watching grew up adoring Jurassic Park and are eager to share that thrill and enjoyment with their own kids with the new franchise. However, so much of the heart and soul of Jurassic Park lies in Spielberg's deft balance of action sequences and emotion. Jurassic World has absolutely none of that as it handles each new sequence with a ham fist. There are glimmers, of course, like the slaughtering of the brachiosaurus at the hands of the new mutant dinosaur, but just as quickly as it appears, it's gone again.

I will admit, I was taken in at moments, my mind drifting into excitement at the discovery of the original park, the revving of those original Jeep engines, the concept of having a raptor as a really intense, really cool dog... I found these moments enjoyable, but none of it has anything to do with the reason the original story took place in the first place-that man should not play God. Clearly no one listened because Spielberg and Co continue to beat a dead horse because ""dinosaurs are cool"" and apparently that's all anyone expects from this franchise.

The original is first and foremost science fiction, with the happy opportunity of being directed by the godfather of the summer blockbuster; It falls into the pleasant position of being excellent at both. However, Jurassic World is just a Frankenstein's Monster dressed in a vintage Jurassic Park t-shirt asking you to love it as it's slowly strangling you to death.",2
Jurassic World,"Why on earth is this stupid park still open?! Just shows - people never learn. Especially when it comes to whether or not to make another movie. Here, I'll answer that because I'm feeling so nice - NO!

The only good thing about the movie was the music. Congrats Michael and John. You saved this review from getting a 1.

That and Chris Pratt's gorgeous face were the only things keeping me from walking out of the cinema right there and then. And the knowledge that I paid fifteen whole dollars to get in.

I could've bought a book with that money...

Oh, you want me to tell you what's wrong with it? Hah, I can't even remember anymore, that movie stayed for one angry day in my memory and then it was gone. The garbage truck came and carried it away. But let me try and recall a few

Number one of things that annoyed me: the graphics. The film makers forgot that we're living in the twenty-first century. Obviously. It was so bad that, instead of gaping in awe at the non-existent, breath-catching graphics, I spent the whole time wondering which dinosaurs were made of plastic and which ones were little men in green suits. I couldn't stop imagining two dudes sitting on top of each other making raptor sounds. Still brings tears of laughter to my eyes.

Number two of what-the-heck-was-this-garbage: the characters. Did the writers not put any effort into their background? Their personalities? Their wants and goals? Wait, I can answer that - NO. Cliché family with cliché problems, cliché older, obnoxious brother, cliché, faraway relative that the kids are shipped off to who, cliché, is totally into their work and doesn't look after them.

Guess what type of character Chris Pratt played.

SPOILER!! He was cliché. Big surprise there. That one dude who's all rogue and sexy, spends his whole time trying to kiss the unemotional, uncaring, uninteresting girl.

SPOILER!! They get together in the end.

Okay, there's one scene that I can't get out of my head - even the trash man couldn't take it out - because it's just so bloody annoying. The kids go missing - duh - and the uninteresting, workaholic girl and sexy-rogue Chris Pratt go on a daring mission to find them. (Let me just point out that she was in a white dress and high heels the whole time). Anyway, they come across this field of dead Brachiosaurus (I had to look that up on google. The movie didn't even teach me that), and there's one lying on the ground twitching its very plastic head up and down. I had to laugh it looked so robotic. Again, all I could think about was some dude hiding behind it, like, moving it around.

So they kneel down next to it and START STROKING ITS HEAD. What. The. Heck. YOUR NEPHEWS ARE OUT THERE IN THE PARK ALONE AND PROBABLY RIGHT NOW GETTING EATEN AND YOU'RE CRYING OVER SOME DINO?! Take into account that she is uncaring, unemotional and completely unsympathetic.

But - you might say - that's character development! No. No that is not. That is the writers creating such shallow and unsustainable characters that they forgot the only trait that stupid woman had in the first place.

If I listed everything that I hated about this movie I'd have to describe every second. Now, at this point, I'd say - well, how 'bout I write about the things I actually did like.

Chris Pratt. The music.

That's it.

So, when do you think Jurassic Park 6 is coming out? I've already got a title – Jurassic Universe. Can't wait to write the review for that",2
Jurassic World,"I watched this snooze fest again last night on TV mainly due to the current hype about the next installment starting at the cinemas. Thought I'd give it another go. I made it to the bit where Godzilla got out before I had to visit the bathroom to puke over this talentless woman's interpretation of her role. Jeez, she looked annoying, she moved annoyingly, she dressed annoyingly and the role itself was beyond stupid. We're becoming way too familiar with this dynoworld thing to the point where nothing is special snymote. Ho hum. My kingdom for a good old fashioned story.",2
Jurassic World,"Jurassic Park has tension. Once the story was established it was like a runaway train. And the two adults and two kids in that movie just held on. It was breathtaking.

Jurassic World has zero tension. Care factor for the characters is minimal. Things happen onscreen and you simply don't feel anything.

And if you can't feel for who's on screen then it becomes a bore.

And then there's someone running through the jungle in high heels...

Go watch the first movie and leave it at that.",2
Jurassic World,"Everyone loved this movie, and I admit it was put together quite well. Great editing, cinematography, editing, script and acting, all very slick. A little too slick, by the book, by the numbers, predictable story line and plot. There is an island. On the island is a dinosaur theme park. The humans have every technological ability to keep the dinosaurs from escaping. That is, until the humans make a dinosaur with DNA from a all these different species that allows it to break free. And then we have nonstop consumption of humans, chasing of the dinosaurs, and by the numbers plot advances, romantic liasians and family friendly cute kid scare scenes (man, if those kids got eaten, this movie would be a 10!) One can almost feel the presence of the big time gambling producers, Steven Spielberg's watchful eye, and every gatekeeper imaginable controlling the thing, until the final result is inevitable: a massive bore-festing yawn-athan I could not wait to be over as I sat uncomfortably in the theater. I wish I had brought edibles with me many times during the over two hour soap opera. Are the special effects awesome? Yes. Is this any different in any way from the previous films, in term of artistic integrity and real risk taking? No. Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots this film is not. Wait for Redbox.",2
Jurassic World,"I had an enormous good time with Jurassic World. I liked the plot and the characters, the pace was very good and suspenseful, and the film culminates in an awesome way that I did not see coming.

Why, then, was I not as scared as I was by the other films? I watched the first movie about a week ago in preparation for this one, and I couldn't block out one question; why does Jurassic World feel less real? The animation is too fluent. A large factor can be blamed on that. Real animals don't move every single joint with every step, like robots. We seem to have a reached a point where too fluent animation results in less connection to reality. Because the dinosaurs don't feel real, they're not as scary. Some animatronics by Stan Winston would've helped. There is even a particular, groan-inducing moment where a character bangs on a window from the outside and leaves his bloody hand imprint on it. That is a B-movie sign right there.

And that's a shame, 'cause Jurassic World is not a B-movie. But the dinosaurs, the way they move and - most crucially - the way they eat people isn't as chillingly real like it felt in Jurassic Park and the unfairly maligned The Lost World.

And you know what the result of that is? You don't fear the dinosaurs like you did in the first movies. The big evil dinosaur in Jurassic World causes a lot of destruction, but it doesn't scare you like the T-Rex did.

In wake of 2014's Godzilla, where they brought a colossal monster to life, Jurassic World has no excuse. I wanted to love it, but it only manages to place third in rank of the four Jurassic Park movies.",2
Jurassic World,"I've only ever been disappointed with thse sequels. The first film had flaws, but all those since have been atrocious and this is no exception. Only watch this if you can skip through the majority of useless crap the filled it with.",2
Jurassic World,"This movie picks up where the last diabolical mess finishes off...

Polished film that is well presented but truly lacks any substance. Chris Pratt is his usual self, forced as the front man that phones this one in.

They try and hit some nostalgia receptors in the brain however if you're only than 10, you can see right through this.

The movie isn't good and is far removed from the greatness of the original and its somewhat decent sequal. As soon as I saw Chris Pratt riding motorbikes with dinosaurs I knew this reboot was doomed forever.

Just an overall miss that fails from the start to the finish.",3
Jurassic World,"Lots of spoilers, in case you haven't seen this brick of a movie:

The boys' parents having marital issues had nothing to do with the movie.


Teenage boys are girl-crazy. We get it, already.


The most exclusive (and probably most expensive) theme park in the world has an unkempt, unintelligent, post-teenage burnout running the hamster ball ride?


The hamster balls had user controls? Who's bright idea was that? I doubt their insurance company knows about this.


When Claire finally becomes a real person, her flat and carefully layered hair becomes full and wavy.


When they release the raptors and Owen is chasing them on a motorcycle, the raptors are constantly jumping over fallen trees and rocks and ducking tree limbs but Owen has a perfectly clear path and, not only does he catch up, he ends up in the middle of them.


In the last scene (think triage), Owen suddenly has a mustache and no other facial hair.


They tried so hard to copy the iconic moments from the first movie (2 raptors vs the tyrannosaur, using a flare to lure the tyrannosaur) but it just comes off as an unimaginative rehash.


Here's the biggest one: real velociraptors were really only two or three feet tall. People have been bringing this up since the first Jurassic Park movie. Owen goes off on Claire for creating the I.Rex, saying it's not a dinosaur because it's modified. What does he think he's training?

I gave this 3 stars because the actors played their roles well. It's a shame they didn't have much to work with.",3
Jurassic World,"My title says it all. This film is nothing more than a ton of special effects, impossible action sequences, and ridiculous writing. Jurassic Park succeeded because it was fresh, well written, and had an exceptional case of actors. You felt the characters' excitement and wonder, and they behaved EXACTLY as a normal human being would. That made the film enjoyable, wonderful, and suspenseful. This movie has exactly zero of any of that. Characters that play park employees (other than the primaries), are slovenly fools, plain and simple. You could care less if they live or die. The boys are not cute, clever, or interesting. They really add nothing to the story, and I suspect they're there to give both teen and preteen girls somebody to (the writers hoped) like in the movie. The main woman is simply a dunce. Other than her physical appearance, she offers nothing of substance to the story. The main game master is really the only believable character - and just barely. Shall we discuss one of my biggest problems with this sorry mess? We've learned through the first three films that in the Jurassic Worlds, Velociraptors are the most intelligent and dangerous animals ever. But In this movie, the powers that be decide it's a good idea to release a pack of these predators to, wait for it, hunt down and contain the new Supersaurus Rex. Of course, there's just no chance the raptors would choose instead to hunt easy human prey is there? Utter balderdash. Hollywood has either forgotten or chooses to ignore a simple truth: MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS BELIEVABLE AND LET THEM ACT LOGICALLY. So, why did I give this even 3 stars? The cinematography was well done...and I like dinosaurs!",3
Jurassic World,"I thought Jurassic World started on a good premise; the original film showed the park fail before it opened, but this film showed a successful park at its peak. And like any theme park, the managers focussing on analysis score and rating etc and typically pushing for anything to raise its performance.

The science of the park led them into genetic engineering, an area they had touched on in the original film as they had completed genetic codes with that on amphibians. But here they ran with it more, using modern techniques to create a dinosaur, the indominus rex.

As in the original Jurassic Park, and a theme that was continued in part by both sequels, the film focused on two children who were related to the main operator of the park (Mr Masrani was basically an investor, not the one who ran the park)

I liked the ideas behind the training of the raptors, building on the underlying premise of Jurassic Park 3 that raptors were smart creatures and, as is human nature, the military were looking to use that to thier advantage.

I though how they set the raptors loose to hunt the indominus rex was a bit predictable, as was the fact that it was part raptor itself and they joined with it to fight/hunt the humans. How did they not see that coming?

I thought how the raptors turned against the indominus rex seemed a bit out of place, yes they probably were closer to Owen as he had raised them, but for lethal pack hunters it seemed a bit implausible. Predictably, and naturally, the indominus rex was winning the fight (it was bigger and stronger with more teeth) and eventually only one raptor remained.

When Clare went to get the tyrannosaur to fight the indominus rex it seemed very odd, a big predator and the main 'villain' of two previous films suddenly easily controlled? Unlikely I realise it had received some training itself with the flare leading to food, but why didn't it try to eat Clare as she was holding the flare?

With the tyrannosaur in the fight the film turned very poor, I can see what they were trying for - nature vs genetic creation - but what they got was a rather pathetic 'tag team' whereby two dangerous predators worked together to fight the indominus rex, leading it to the pool where the mosasaurus finished it off. Then to add insult to injury the tyrannosaur and raptor shared a 'knowing look' before going their separate ways, it was very cheesy and I was half-expecting them to high-five.

The ending seriously let this film down, a film that started so promisingly.",3
Jurassic World,"Nice idea nice sets but who cares acting is not there

the good actors are kept in the background poor execution",3
Jurassic World,"Jurassic Park is a movie classic. Period. Yes, the sequels were never even close to the level, but at least they were entertaining. We can't say the same about Jurassic World. It's obvious that this is just a cash-grab aimed at nostalgic fans. Forget about the interesting characters, incredible effects, and compelling story of the original... surprise, this is the opposite. We couldn't care less about our protagonists, they're poorly written and mediocre performances don't help. The script is so stupid that it's funny what happens on screen, at least you can laugh about it. The effects are uninteresting, they don't help the action scenes at all, they're really tedious. Really bad sequel, just go and see the original

Oh, I almost forget about the high heels...that's comedy gold.",3
Jurassic World,My rating would have been a 8 if she'd been mangled to shreds by any of the dinosaurs. or even a 9 if Chris Pratt would have pulled her high heels off and beaten her to death with them.,3
Jurassic World,"How is it possible that a 1993 movie has better special effects than a movie from 2015. It looks fake and the acting is terrible, the story is super predictable. The original JP was the best and was amazing. Avoid this one by all costs!",3
Jurassic World,"Only made it about 45 minutes in and then left the theatre. The story was underwhelming, mostly just flash to inundate your brain.",3
Jurassic World,"Action and adventure movies like this one is always fun to watch. But this one is so ridiculous in many ways, like kids missing but no one thought of calling them on their cell phone, breaking cell phones signals all the time, broadcast only comes on and creating panic the last second before all the flying dinosaurs are coming in to hurt people, the boys knowing they are in a park with certain level of danger but would happily head into the restricted area... but one of the worst parts is Bryce Howard is on her heels the whole time during all the chase and all the running around! REALLY?! ARE YOU SERIOUS? At least have her changing into a pair of sneakers whenever she has the chance right?!",3
Jurassic World,"The actors and actresses did a great job with what they had which to be honest was a story with a myriad of plot holes and logic errors.

First off the Indominus Rex's abilities seem to constantly change when it is convenient. One second it can sense thermal heat until the main character is under a car then it doesn't know where he is. Another time they continually mention it has a great sense of smell which Owen (Chris Pratt's character) needs to cover himself in gas to hide from it. Then once again when it isn't important to the story it can't smell them behind the jeep. Another skill that conveniently disappears is its ability to blend in to its surroundings. It was used two or three times then it never used it again.

I also wonder why there wasn't there a evacuation procedure? Even if they could have perfect containment of the dinosaurs there are still times you will need to evacuate. Shoot even Disneyland has evacuation procedures and they don't have dinosaurs than can eat people in one bite.

Why is so many enclosures made of glass? There were so many times I wondered why some of the carnivores (like the Mosasaurus) had only glass around it. They went under water to see the Mosasaurus and I saw nothing stopping it from getting the people except the glass.

Then there is the Gyrospheres a ride where people drive these completely glass pods that let people in a area with the herbivores. Fist off how is that safe and why was there no automatic recall? Without automatic recall a person can be with the Dino's all day and would stop others from getting a chance to see the dinosaurs.

Why doesn't Claire keep the gun she was using? While we are talking about Claire why would you get in a car and drive to call headquarters? Wouldn't it be best to call right away? I also didn't like the convenient bad signal when the Indominus Rex was about ready to attack. Does it have some electrical field around it that jams signals or something because I could understand once or twice but it was way overused. I also find it interesting that Clare was able to outrun a t-Rex on foot in heels when we know from the first film it could almost catch up to a car.

The T-Rex also didn't eat the humans at the end which was completely baffling considering it was ready to eat.

Also i wonder how they contained all the Dino's from the first films. It was never explained and yet surprisingly we find out it is the same place.

I also felt no connection to most of characters so everyone that died had little impact and felt like they were added to die instead of having good character development.

Ohh and the main characters decide it is a good time to kiss right in the middle of a dangerous moment where Pterodactyl are attacking people left and right. The two boys that were watching decide not to panic and ask who the guy was. I'm pretty sure most people would be looking for cover instead of nonchalantly kissing someone.

There are more errors but I think this is enough.

Also there is a lot of product placement in this movie that brings you out of the moment.

The best thing that came from this movie is the ""How it should have ended"" youtube video.",3
Jurassic World,"I'm hoping that this will be the final sequel in the franchise. For my taste, it has outlived it's interest level. The film plays like ""look what we can do now with CGI and the concept of genetic manipulation"". It was boring, trite, predictable and overly contrived. Story line lacked dynamic appeal. Acting sub par. The CGI was good but one would expect it to be given advancements in technology to date. Over all a disappointment and in my view, the worst installment in the series even surpassing Jurassic Park 2 for that spot. I guess that it wold be a reasonable rental for a$1.50 at Redbox if your're having trouble with insomnia or if you're looking to complete the viewing of the whole franchise. Beyond that I think it would be fair to say that this film fell far short of my expectations.",3
Jurassic World,"I'm finding it very hard to believe these positive reviews. Must be bots posting or studio employees. I'm sorry to say, and was hoping for a good story, but this movie is a total mess. The dialog and acting was incredibly sub par. It's almost like they either gave up or lost inspiration in multiple scenes.

The critics have this one right.",3
Jurassic World,"I didn't watch this series before because I didn't really feel the need to invest in a similar film again.

It's a sweltering heat today, and I don't have the heart to do anything meaningful - like watching a good movie - just when I saw it on the menu... I just saw half of it now, I can't help it, I must evaluate it!

Technical aspects: Any other country in the world is still far from the level of the United States, and it is far from being able to produce effects of the same quality... This is, probably, must be the only advantage of the United States that can disdain any other part of the world.

Humanities: The story and background are very old-fashioned, it's just a direct copy of the previous script.

Characters: It can be said that there are many characters, wonderful! Let me introduce them. They are: Stupid No. 1, Stupid No. 2, Stupid No. 3, Stupid No. 4, Stupid No. 5... Stupid No. N. All kinds of stupidity and sluggishness. In short, there is an endless stream of idiots coming out of the minds of these American screenwriters.

The only one who is really smart is that dinosaur!

Ps: Some people may say that the male protagonist is not stupid! ? Excuse me, he knows what kind of devil he is dealing with, so what is he going to do with a BB gun?",3
Jurassic World,"Certainly one the worst big-budget movies this year, ""Jurassic World"" is recycled, rehashed and devoid of intelligence. I can't recall the other predecessor movies (Jurassic Park and it's mediocre to poor sequels) even as bad as this pond scum. The product placement is gratiutious and shameful. - Mercedes, Coca-cola, Imax etc....There is bloat-scenes all over the place - pure filler fat. The lack of intelligence of this movie is remarkable considering the its budget. Dialog is utterly PG tepid. Scene after scene of stink with inane fighting supposedly of security men skirmishing with predators. Half- hearted limp character development fizzles out within the first 20 min. Steer clear, not worth your time - a total dud 3/10",3
Jurassic World,"Acting talent no longer necessary. Trite, cliched dialog, and wooden acting can't save this 50's monster sci-fi update. Greedy corporation designs unstoppable monsters for their theme park. Would have been better with Peter Graves or Kevin McCarthy. I gave it a 3 because the CGI was great.

Trivia: Heroine never breaks a high heel even running through the jungle. Women don't have to pulled along by the male hero anymore!",3
Jurassic World,"The story line is decent and the cinematography is superb. But repeated escapes and sloshing thru mud without getting dirty, running thru a jungle in high heels like an Olympic Sprinter, and a score of other unbelievable acts make this suitable for next to nothing.

If I'm 10 I love this. If I'm 20 I am getting tired. If I am 30 and watch this I'm desperate and dateless. If I'm 40 my kids made me. If I'm 50 I have no excuse. If I'm 60 and watching this it's because the constant bickering between CNN and Fox has me sick to my stomach. If I'm 70 it is noise while I nap. If I'm 80 and watching it's because this is part of movie night at my Senior Care facility.",3
Jurassic World,"I was excitedly awaiting for this movie to be released, and I was not expecting to be as disappointed as I was. I have followed the Jurassic Park World from the beginning, and I am glad this rehashing of Jurassic Park is over.

I was incredibly disappointed by the lack of dinosaur screen time compared to the 20+ characters; to the ever expanding plot that just used the dinosaurs as an afterthought.

When the dinosaurs did appear on screen, I loved it. It was grand, memorable, and worth the ticket, but that was never the forefront of the movie. So those moments were few and far between.

I truly had great expectations, and was sadly disappointed in more ways than one. Just watch Jurassic Park (the original) if you still have a craving to watch this movie after this review. Even if you have seen it a hundred times as I have, at least you want experience the crushing blow that I receive tonight.

Maybe they made the ever ending new addition characters the main focus of the movie because this movie focused on dinosaurs in ""our world"" now. But, I do think that was 100% a flaw. Even if the dinosaurs are in our world now, they could have explored more into what that looks like, and not have those topics or subjects covered as an afterthought.",3
Jurassic World,"Colin Trevorrow directed and wrote this thing seemingly ensuring the main starCGIwould not be overshadowed by quality acting. Well donebravo. 'J-World' is a fine example of a director taking an outstanding cast and relegating them all to second-fiddle. It is sad enough when talented actors have a sluggish script forced upon them, but these people also had to love-hug stupid, overly friendly cartoon dinosaurs. I am convinced 'Barnie' could have saved this hot mess – I kid – nothing could save this from the oil pits. I will say that Special effects were some of the best I have ever seen...spectacular. I did say the cast was pretty good and it is. Chris Pratt normally plays a fun character and he is probably the main reason I paid to watch this celluloid waist. This time the guy was OKnot for lack of tryinghe just didn't have much to work with. No snarky 'Guardians of the Galaxy' personajust a sense of mediocre interest in the project and a desire to have 'Jurassic World' far behind him. It was almost like he enjoyed filming this production as much as I liked sitting through It. NowI actually enjoyed Bryce Dallas Howard. She is the one actor who actually seemed to have a developed character written for her (by whoI have no clue) but she did manage to carry her part off without a hitch. She has chops, and I would like to see more of her. As excellent as Bryce was, there was no saving the cash-drain of a mind-number. Irrfan Khan is talented but ended up being just OKI think he was the good-bad guyVincent D'Onofrio is very skilled, but ended up as being just alright, I assume he is the really bad-bad military guy (trendy and popular evil-doers). What the heck, the rest of casteaten or not eaten were OK – at best. Nobody was really great. Without a script, no one actually gets a chance to stand out. This movie could have been very good, but pointless direction and messy writing took a lot of excellent potential and made a bad product. How bad? Wellno need to compare this to some other Jurassic version, Ed Wood provided better comparison material back in the 50's and 60's. What were the six writers doing anyways? It definitely wasn't writing. I know plots are stupid things to have in a movie now-a-daysI got itbut some character development would be nice. Example? The Chris Pratt character, Owen, is important because he was in the Navy. OMG the Navy or THE NAVY? I spent twenty years in the Navypainful and irritating at times.but important? Huh? Really? Oh and the kids were at the park because.? Mommy and daddy were divorcingsounds like that's never been used before - not. Spineless parents wont even tell the kids. Oh and the dinosaurs speak to and understand Owen - can I have a big Dino-WOW – and the carnivorous ones are nice and friendly tooanother Dino-WOW. Can't we all just get along with raptors and tyrannosaurus rex...they just want to be our dino-buddies...oh yes...another dino-WOW. In the original renditions, raptors were the super villains, in this installment, they are man's bestest buddies. Snuggly- huggly-ooey-gooey dinosaurs...give me a big.yabba-dabba-doo-doo gag. If you enjoy senseless movies that are poorly written and when they are over you ask yourself, 'Why did I pay for this garbage?' – then Jurassic World is for you. Me, I will never pay to see another Jurassic production, and I may avoid future flicks sanctioned by Spielberg.",3
Jurassic World,"The plot is all over the place. The characters are silly, the dinosaurs are silly, the events are predictable and silly. Then again, the characters, while hardly three-dimensional, are at least not total cardboard cutouts and dinosaur meat. Since Hollywood has lowered our expectations dramatically during the past two decades, one has to appreciate even such small positives. However, here is the problem: the film doesn't know what it's about. It focuses entirely on two brothers during Act 1, only to drop them almost completely and explore a romantic relationship between two secondary characters, and then go straight to the great dinosaur chase involving trained dinosaurs (!), which is clearly intended as the greatest attraction of this Jurassic tour. At the end of the day, this is just a mildly entertaining film, and a way to waste another couple of hours of your life. There is nothing original here, and it comes across as more of a ride than an actual film. A ride you've visited many times before and are somewhat bored of. Ironically, the film itself says that the dinosaurs in the park have become dull for the audiences. How true.",3
Jurassic World,"If I had paid money to see this, I would have been furious. The plot wavers back and forth between non-existent and idiotic. The characters are so generic and predictable that you know what each of them is going to do within 10 seconds of seeing them on screen. By 10-15 minutes into the movie, you are actually rooting for the dinosaurs to eat EVERYONE including the producers, writers, and studio executives who signed off on this crapfest.

When I saw the opening weekend box office numbers, I was appalled. It does not say much about American intellect that a movie this horrible can set box office records.

This movie was a scam. How little do we have to do to fleece the audience out of a half billion dollars in one weekend?

Are we, as a nation, this stupid?",3
Jurassic World,"This movie is really, really bad. There is no story except for the one in the synopsis...dino escapes from enclosure and starts eating people.

That is the entire plot. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialog is horrible, the acting is stilted, although that may be due to the comic book dialog.

I should have known better than to go to a sequel...99.9% of the time they are terrible, and this was no exception. It may be the worst sequel in history!

I thought perhaps that enough time had gone by since the original movie premiered for writers to come up with a decent scenario, but I think all the writers are on strike or something. There really is very little dialog to speak of...pun intended.

I could not wait for this fiasco to end. Save your money and watch Fred Flintstone reruns...you'll be happier.",3
Jurassic World,"It's like they're not even hiring or involving writers at all to make movies these days. They're in such a hurry to tell this story that the dinosaurs begin to go haywire before the viewers can decide whether they care if anyone besides Chris Pratt dies. Turns out we don't.

It's almost as if they just hurried through this one because it was just a way to lay the ground work for future JP movies that are equally ill-considered. I hope the Jurassic World ride and theme park at Disney World is a little more subtle about taunting attendees the way they did movie-goes ""Aren't the lower classes hebetudinous dullards, Chauncy? I daresay they will jam their corpulent behinds in dirty theater seat over and over to drool on one another and stare at it!!! Mwa hahaha!!!""

There is nothing remotely clever, surprising, or even funny that happens in this plot line whatsoever. A person who had never seen this movie could tell you what it was about by guessing randomly at the title...which is apparently how the screenwriter did it...or at the very least the suits that overrode every last decent idea the writers had and superimposed their own idiotic vision instead.

I'm sure all the flat-earth mouth-breathers who don't even believe dinosaurs existed will be gratified to see science mocked by the cinematic equivalent of hurling feces at people meant to represent the academics they mock with Intelligent Design Museums.

Would people run randomly in the streets and not into the building while pterodactyls flew overhead snatching people up and eating them? Would a brief appearance by Jimmy Buffet (didn't notice) distract from all the bad writing and stupid characters? Tons of Jurassic herbivores...no Jurassic plant life. The female lead is thoroughly unlikable in ever way and doesn't die. And her hair is so awful...a better stylist would have covered all of that face. Hey I wonder if the dumb rich guy is gonna die in a helicopter crash after they've dropped a dozen damn hints about how bad he is at flying? Oh...he's dead two minutes after he takes off. Heli crash. The walls are all woefully short. Real animals can jump like kangaroos on WW2 surplus crank...but a four-meter hybrid predator should be okay in an enclosure with no roof...right? Pretty much NO ONE can outrun a damn lizard of any size...except maybe a chameleon. The main dino can change colors but they didn't use the word ""chromatophores"" a word every ten year old knows? Nope, the entire premise of this movie is that either the producers are really stupid or this is how stupid they think most people are.

To say this is like John Wick with dinosaurs is giving the writers and producers credit for having spent any time on anything other than the broad concepts of the movie and the title...which they didn't. Hollywood is actively trying to insult Americans' intelligence and most people don't even have enough brains to be insulted...shame shame shame.",3
Jurassic World,"This is an embarrassingly bad movie. The pinnacle of brain-dead, auto pilot Spielbergism. Everything from a horrible script to a complete retread of a music - everything is awful. For Hollywood this defines the cronyism and the current lack of creativity. It's a Kentucky Fried Chicken of movie-making. Someone needs to make a mock version of this crap. Kind of like Spaceballs did with Star Wars. $180 million ??? for what? And somewhat positive critical reviews? have they all been bought? The movie is a non-stop orgy of clichés. Every twist and turn is entirely predictable and makes you feel bad for the writers and directors who seemed to be trying hard, but producing total drivel. Do not subsidize this trash. We the viewers deserve better.",3
Jurassic World,"I expected to actually enjoy this movie. I love dinosaur movies and I loved all the old Jurassic Park movies. Although this movie (forgivably) lacks many of the elements that made the Jurassic Park movies so good, like a decent theme, a moral, and underlying character conflict, it also lacks characters that we can identify with or have any concern for. Even this might be forgivable, but at some points, the characters (portrayed rather flatly by incompetent acting/directing) act so idiotically, that I found myself actually hoping they would get what was deservedly coming to them, knowing that they probably wouldn't, and indeed they didn't. I find myself more tolerant of evil in a character, then just plain stupidity; and sadly, due to poor scripting, storyline, or directing, the main characters in this movie just came off as stupid, idiotic fools. While the CGI was fantastic, I really couldn't help but feel it didn't make up for having to suffer through 90 minutes of listening to vapid characters.",3
Jurassic World,"I watched the original and then this back-to-back. The original is scary without excessively pushing the idea of the dinosaurs constantly, the threat of them being there is enough. Parts I hated especially were the main characters and civilians running for their lives and impending doom, the main characters stopping in the middle of a road to have a 5 minute chat seemingly forgetting about the immediate threat. There is action, it is just done lazily and predictably.

Some of the comic relief works, but the movie really needed to work out what it wanted to be. It's no longer a action thriller, and in turn becomes a faux action comedy of sorts.",4
Jurassic World,"Just about the only good thing I can say about this movie is that the ""powers that be"" overcame the urge to feed their only in-the-field black actor to the dinosaurs. Close, but he seems to have escaped. Vincent D'Onofrio was over-the-top great as the bug in Men In Black, but that was a great script and an excellent part. Here, he had little to work with except dreadful lines. I seriously think that most fault for the bad acting and poor production lies with the casting department and perhaps the direction. It's unfortunate because many people clearly put all they had into special effects, stunts, makeup, etc. In the end, the poor script, less-than-stellar editing, the nonsense character development, and bad casting just didn't work. I hated the character of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) right from her first mumbling words. She had zero charisma, dreadful taste in outfits, and we were apparently expected to suddenly like her just because she picked up a rifle and shot a dinosaur. Most everything that wasn't implausible was taken directly from the original Jurassic Park. Deus ex machina is often effectively used to put the main characters in danger, only to save them in the final seconds of their lives by an implausible interruption. They did it in Jurassic Park using a T-Rex, and it was fun. But here, they did it ad nauseam.

The two kids had no purpose in the movie except to get into trouble and scare the audience into thinking they were in danger. Children are rarely in any real danger in blockbuster movies.

Chris Pratt was good, but they shouldn't have made him kiss Claire just because she shot the dinosaur that was about to eat him. She only did it because she wore heels to the jungle, which made it too difficult to run away.

I'm glad I didn't go to the theater to see this. Although, I suspect that the sound of the audience groaning would have made it easier to get through.",4
Jurassic World,"It comes as surprising that with rigorous developments in everything related to entertainment industry, the industry itself has managed to thrust itself into poopholes—they've become lame, lethargic, greedy, and stupid. They've stuck to visuals as the only assets to financial boom. When did they start working for the IRS? If readers don't agree, they ought to follow the Jurassic Park franchise in the right order. The first piece—true Spielbergian—reflected Michael Crichton, or maybe it just didn't have Thomas Tull (f**k you!) as a producer. The second wasn't critically acclaimed, but audiences loved it, so did I. I liked even the third one; there was this kind of momentum to it—the vigor that connected the trilogy, gave it smoothness. And that was 1.5 decades ago. I guess the Jurassic aura became ""the lost world"" in this gap. Because as far as Jurassic World is concerned, it's a clichéd work similar to Gareth Edwards' twice-its-original-size dinosaur (body-building Godzilla,) and struggles to build up thrill and suspense till the very last moment but severely fails to do so.

It expects audiences to have patience for the first two hours, enjoy the Disneyland of infant and herbivore dinosaurs, eat popcorn, run out of popcorn, and leave before the T-Rex comes to save the day. Even in that, a comedy of errors takes place, and T-Rex himself is saved only by the incidental intervention of Mososaur, who happens to victimize Indominus, not T-Rex, mind you! So what actually saves the day is not Owen (Chris Pratt,) not at all Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard,) not the trying-to-be-swagger Masrani (Irrfan Khan,) and not even turned-doggy velociraptors, it happened to be the shark-eating, and fortunately dino-eating water-dinosaur who knew the movie's about to end, and so he has to play a part. Yep, that's the spoiler, and that's the end. When everything dies and goes away, the freed T-Rex is not the thing to worry about—and this actually mocks the other movies (Jurassic 1 and 2 kinda bred on T-Rex no?) Back then, they had to get rid of T-Rex (and in JP-2, T-Rexes, actually,) but here it had to be Indominus. And T-Rex was kind enough to go back like a half-tamed cat without accelerating forward to cause some further chaos. Bloody lunatics, all of them. And If Steven Spielberg is the executive producer, like they said in the credits, he should probably apologize already.

Loopholes don't end here. The hybrid Indominus, as revealed later on, is half-Rex and half-Raptor. There's that. Okay. And he still seems to camouflage (okay, even that was explained in a lame, unbelievable way) and knows that the park has thermal speculation everywhere, so knows how to dodge that (simply amazing, no? After all, a dino has a better sense than humans, or at least Trevorrow and Tull.)

The one thing that touched the heart was John William's Jurassic Park theme, redefined in its own way by Michael Giacchino (Carl goes up, he sure does.) It's warming, and very sentimental, mostly because of its nostalgic characteristic. I wouldn't say that the soundtrack suited perfectly with the movie—where everything's modernized (I'm talking about the park and everything,) it doesn't really makes any sense to keep retaining the old version. I know it was altered, but that too was out of cohesion. I struggled to mold my emotions to the Stone Age, but just couldn't. And every once in a while, I'd try to remember Hammond's stare at his mosquito-stick, and ride back in the helicopter to get my love for Jurassic back, but nothing worked. As said earlier, it was Thomas Tull,(excellent producer for sci-fi(s), worst for dinos) to a great extent. The guy spoiled my memories of Godzilla, and has successfully spoiled my memories of this one.

Jurassic World brings all dinosaurs back to life, but fails to make them lovable, for both children, parents, and fellow dinosaurs. Late in the day, came Patt's German Shepherds, but as it turned out, they weren't so loyal. But eventually when it came to his life, they were. How did that happen? From what was shown in the movie, and from I interpreted, and I know my interpretation doesn't suck, I'd say the movie sucks enormously. Gareth Edwards, oopsi, Colin Trevorrow, is trying to tell us that animal instinct flushes away in the blink of an eye? And rather than running for their own lives, the Raptors preferred risking everything to save the lead? C'mon, guys!

I understand that I must not expect a lot from and action/adventure/thriller in terms of utter genius, but this wasn't genius, leave alone ""utter."" This was a crappy attempt at regaining potential Jurassic audiences to make some money. Somewhere deep, and I'll sound retarded here, I feel these Sci-fi geeks are over-obsessed with genetic modifications that's why every other movie talks about ""genetic codes"" and blah blah blah. Have a go at ordinariness; it's miles better, I'm telling you.

Now, in the very last, I'll discuss the cast. The soon-to-be Temple Runner (Indiana Jones,) and obviously Steven Spielberg's favorite Chris Pratt, plays equal-to-nothing role quite marvelously. By marvelously, I mean he did what was expected, and that's about it. I loved Bryce's Claire. Her personality, unawareness of nephews' age, and don't-exactly-know-when-I-last-saw-you ambivalence, coupled with baffling stripping to get ready for some action, which almost gave a pretty arousing feeling, was beyond lovely. Her hairstyle, clothing, and cocky-but-mocky attitude made it all possible. And then there was her assistant (Katie McGrath of Labyrinth,) who cocked me up despite having a minor performance. As for others, there's nothing substantial to talk about, except to say that they carried JW to its end, without further lagging it down.

JW evidences, much like Transformers: Age of Extinction, and The Hobbit trilogy, that gaps and deviances are costlier. Audiences go back with stains on their nostalgia, and critics get something to write about, in detail, and that sucks. Seriously!",4
Jurassic World,"I was excited to see the Jurassic world film, for weeks. Yesterday i say at the cinema and then...

This film is the same story as the last films. There is no innovation or something new. The biggest difference is changing the name from Jurassic park to world.

WTF? The new genetic ultra t-Rex with his hiding skills is one of the stupid things i have ever seen. The fight at the end is an example for loosing imaginativeness. The movie is transparent to every time. You know the whole time what happens next.

I think its time for Spielberg to get out of the business. Same old jokes, things ever and ever again.

I was really unhappy for paying for this movie.",4
Jurassic World,"If you've seen Jurassic Park then you've seen the updated version with better CGI. Even though it wasn't directed by Steve, it smacks of his plotting. There are kids at risk, studly good guy, flaky damsel, money-grubbing owner and the evil security mastermind. Same as the first film. The animals were very life-like and the digital artists earned their pay. But what to do with these wonderful creatures is what drags this epic down. The screen writing and story were shaky and trite. As Captain Barbosa once said: ""It does stretch credulity."" There were too many inconsistencies throughout the film to list. However, the most disturbing part of the movie was when the research doctor and all of the embryos were airlifted out - thus - ensuring a sequel or four.",4
Jurassic World,"Well, the only thing this movie had going for it was the throwbacks to the original. Character dialogue is weak, too few tense scenes, too much cgi.

The characters also jarringly change their outlook on life halfway through the film. Chris Pratt wasn't too bad. The army guy was okay too.

This movie feels incredibly rushed. I felt none of the awe the original inspired. The only thing that got my blood pumping was the few times they used the music from the original.

Slightly entertaining if you're bored. If you're a fan of JP 1 & 2, I think you might be disappointed. I won't be watching this again.",4
Jurassic World,"Jurassic World is not bad, is not good. It's binary fine: one bit this way, one bit that way. The ""world"" is, and exists only because some well-off humans can afford to blow some dispensable income on travelling to an island for a few days to gawk at the amazingness that is an unethical use of science.

The movie is superficially pro-science, giving evolution its second 15 minutes of fame. We can create fantastical entertainment, but it might also kill us. Modern problems sure are two-edged swords!

We have a throwaway plot, that profit is king, and privilege is best when you are on an island full of over 20,000 people trying to outlive a gaggle of pterodactyls. And let me put on my ""old man"" hat to say the movie is unnecessarily cruel and sadistic, with the British assistant suffering a worse death than anything from the Final Destiny movies, to the bitey-biteyness of all the bloody dino fights.

Sad, sad, sad, we must feel at the pointless murder of all the happy-go-lucky, vegetarian, apatosauruses, who in reality are nothing but a stream of ones and zeroes. The cruel world spawned by an Asian biologist and an Arabic boss-man-owner is just an island of corporate greed, floating on each scene's profit models, only to have the Pretty White People swoop in and save most of the visitors. Never mind the Tyrannosaurus Rex nor the countless pterodactyls running amok and wantonly. It's an adventure of privilege, a privileged adventure.

Star Lord reprises his iconic role as Butt Lord, the only man in the world who can relate to lizards because he's the only one who treats them with respect and treats them like they're real animals. Plus, he was also in the Navy (and is not a Navajo), so he really knows how to stroke a lizard.

What's a villain? Who's a bad person? Corporate greed and its devotees. Everyone bad dies savagely, and no one good suffers too much. That's why we all need to make Good Life Choices. We should never play God with life, that's pushing it too far, and none of this mess would have been possible without evil scientists' desires to control and improve upon God's design.

Instead, we should commodify the human spirit, body, and soul. We should make everyone desire the same things, so we can maximize profit by reducing the cost of producing or tolerating variety. Watch as a fine-tuned machine mechanically separates chickens. With time and a spirit of the will, someday a machine will mechanically separate people.

Near the midpoint, the Pretty White People find an overgrown, old Jurassic Park spot, a reminder of the first movie, a movie that was better in nearly every way. It no longer matters whether the CGI looks or feels real. You simply watch in awe that professional actors could ever deliver such crappy dialogue without laughing or wincing.",4
Jurassic World,"Spoilers ahead.

The whole movie is badly written. D'Onofrio and Pratt's acting couldn't save this poor attempt at some nostalgia ca$h grabbing. Given the film's budget, the CGI could have been much better. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. But it was quite generic.

The dinosaurs were laughable at best, ridiculous most of the time. For a dinosaur movie, there was NO tension at all! The main characters were never in danger. Not even an injury, a bite, a scratch, nothing!

Howard' character is running through mud and stones with a pair of high heels, she never even falls or gets her skirt damaged. The secondary characters' deaths are barely suggested, the camera turning away when the I-Rex bites them. What's the point?

I'm not saying it should be a gore fest a la RAMBO but come on. What about the characters' totally illogical decisions? Let's watch the T-Rex fight the main enemy instead of running away !

What about the Velociraptor that was hit by a car and in the final fight, Deus Ex Machina style arrives just in time to save the day? It could have been a great movie, but there was zero tension.",4
Jurassic World,"Extremely disappointing. I was thinking about hitting the ""spoiler alert"" button but this movie was so recycled and dry that there was no need. Let me first address the acting. Pretty bad. Ty Simpkins (Insidious) gave the best performances and even outshined Chris Pratt, who is usually outstanding, but he was mildly amusing and too badass for a Chris Pratt like character. The film was lazy, poorly executed and it was one of the few films where I wanted it to be over. Save for some good but not great CGI and special effects, the movie was not stunning nor extraordinary like a Jurassic movie should be. They didn't even bother explaining anything, they simply dove right into the action that people distinguish as ""a good movie"". However, I am a huge fan of Chris Pratt and I always enjoy seeing him even if he's not his usual self. He's not that great of an actor, he can play one character, the goofy, lovable, mildly stupid hero, but he still somehow delivered to me even through his mediocre performance. I would just skip this movie all together, as it's 2 hours of your life better spent watching Ant Man or Southpaw that you'll never get back.",4
Jurassic World,"Where do I start? The main character is pretty amazing and is a really cool guy and overall great acting from him (Chris Pratt) and it does have nostalgic feelings from the original Jurassic Park however I have rated it 4/10 because 3 of the 4 raptors died and that is very sad and disheartening and to be honest in a few days that other raptor would of probably been hunted down by some government and killed anyway, not only that he was on his own too. My ending to the movie would of been the 4 raptors distract the Rex long enough for the annoying kids and bad aunt to get into a safer place while Chris Pratt finds an ingenious way to lure the Rex over to the water and let the Mosasaurus deal with it instead and the raptors walk away free and run off into the wild and then just before the credits roll it an announcement saying that Jurassic World will be left alone to the dinosaurs and creatures inhabiting it however the work Ingen and the genetics lab done would be completely abolished and Jurassic World will be left as a reminder that dinosaurs were dead for a reason. That is my alternate ending that I have come up with to keep the raptors alive. My version 9/10, Raptor Slaughter version 4/10",4
Jurassic World,"Jurassic World opens up 22 years after Jurassic Park closed down with a new scary genetically modified hybrid-dinosaur to showcase, the Indominus Rex. An intelligent killing machine that is created to please the crowds and generate escapes on the fully packed amusement island. Can the islands private military rescue the situation, or will it be the original monster T-Rex or is it everyone's favourite goofy guy Chris Pratt well-trained Velociraptors that saves them all?

A new Jurassic Park film, a new leading actor, a new dinosaur and a new theme park. Jurassic World has got some good casting with the likes of the entertaining Chris Pratt, the charming Omar Sy, funny guy Jake Johnson, Judy Greer, Bryce Dallas Howard, Irrfan Khan, and with the original Jurassic Park BD Wong as Dr Henry Wu. Unfortunately the script and dialogue don't really make it happen for them to succeed. With some nods back to the first two films directed by Steven Spielberg you get some feel for it but otherwise it is just the latest addition to the Jurassic Park franchise and for new generations to pick up on.",4
Jurassic World,"Where do I begin with this film? Well I found this film very boring and very pointless. This is a film that is bad with some good aspects, the good aspects include the directing is okay and the audience sees okay character development that shows us that these characters can be related to and understood. The other good aspect about this film would be that it doesn't use shaky cam. However this film has a lot of problems and the first of which in my opinion is the special effects, they are not very special the CGI used has made the dinosaurs look fake, they looked better in the original film. The second thing I didn't like is that this film is not well paced the script is not written that well because the action does not take place until the second hour of this film. The other thing that annoys me is that some of the characters on screen do stupid things and nothing ever happens to them. Overall this is film does not live up to the original at all, I think that some people will like this very much but I didn't because this film was just a cash grab and was pointless and very predictable which made it less entertaining.",4
Jurassic World,"I expected a lot of good things from this movie, and I re-watched all three Jurassic Park movies this past week to get ready for this one.

But I gotta say, Jurassic World is over-hyped and surprisingly bad. It isn't absolutely terrible or anything, and Chris Pratt does a highly decent job with what he has to work with, but it's still easily the worst of the four. Yes, I said it. Jurassic Park 3 is a better movie than Jurassic World. Let's just skip the fact that the special effects actually looked more realistic 20 years ago (!!!) and go straight to the meat of it...

The beginning of the movie was filled with silly conversations of stereotypical character that made my brain hurt, the plot quickly developed into something far fetched and unnecessarily ridiculous, plot twists were cliché and/or even more far fetched, the ending was wrapped up with a icky-sweet and stupid moment, and last, but not least, the movie left us with some gigantic plot holes. I mean, we're talking inexcusably unresolved problems at the end of the movie, that rendered everything pretty meaningless. I'm left questioning the professional abilities of the writers and the director.

What were they thinking?! As I'm writing this, The Lost World has a 6.5 rating, while Jurassic World has a 7.1 rating. That is unbelievable. No way is this a better movie than The Lost World.

All in all, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it. Go ahead and bring out the popcorn and drinks! Just don't expect movie history to be made. Sure, there were a couple of cool moments and some nice scenes, but nothing like in the first two, and sadly the CG stuff quite honestly make things less believable. I think the movie is mostly saved by Chris Pratt being quite badass, so there's that to look forward to.",4
Jurassic World,"I wasted 2 hours of my time and watched this movie, but it was not worth it. Why I say that? 1. A really weak screenplay. Actors keep doing some stupid things that even a stupid person don't do. It seems it's a tradition in some horror movies, but I didn't expect it in Jurassic world. It is a superficial movie which don't satisfy serious audiences. 2. Long introduction. You should wait a long time for the main story to start. 3. Lack of rationality. It doesn't seem rational that a center which has such a high technology to create hybrid dinosaurs, has nothing to face with this critical problem but a number of man and some automatic guns! No army,no air force, no advanced gun, nothing. There are many examples. 4. Why two hours? When you have nothing to say, why you direct a 2-hours movie?",4
Jurassic World,"So the park has opened (again) with the main star being another (bigger/nastier) T-Rex (again) with a clutch of Velociraptors in a supporting role (again). There's a couple of annoying kids (again) being chased (again) while others are trying to unsuccessfully stop the 'T-Rex' (again) whilst a splinter group are using the situation for their own financial gain (again)!

This movie is just a predictable polish of the original on a grander scale. The story is weak, the casting and acting the same - polished with some extra CGI.

The overused Velociraptors (again) seem to be suffering from a crisis of conscience. One minute they're supposed to be subordinate to Starlord but, 2min later they are trying to kill/eat him, to then happily going on a road trip with him 30min later, to then trying to eat him again (after a quick chat with the 'V-Rex') only to then decide they're on the side of humanity after all.

The whole thing comes across as a shoddy visual spectacle designed by committee which fails miserably.

I'm not sure how many times it is possible to rehash the same idea but with a sequel in the pipeline it looks like Hollywood is trying again...",4
Jurassic World,"Jurassic World, the sequel we all wanted? My response to this question would be no. This movie does remind us of one thing for sure though, Spielberg knew how to not rely on CGI, and still have an entertaining story and well-rounded characters. That is the biggest issue that I have with this movie. Jurassic World's director, Colin Trevorrow thrives in one of those categories and lacks in the others. Our lead actors Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) are perfectly fine, but it seems that there is something holding them back. Maybe it is the four writers this movie had? Or maybe it is the constant product placement that is used. This problem continues throughout the movie with some of the supporting actors as well. We get a bland underdeveloped teen (Zach) that is focused on his phone and girls, and his little brother (Gray) who is fine but predictable. At times, the movie had me entertained though. I think there is something about dinosaurs that amazes us all, considering this is the 4th installment of a ""Jurassic Park"" movie. Audiences want to see these huge creatures tear people up, and I am with those people. The CGI is nice, and we get to see new dinosaurs like the Mosasaurus who refreshing and is good for marketing the movie. I can respect the fun that this movie is, but is hard to take seriously when you can see through the whole marketing gimmick that this movie is. I guess the gimmick worked though, $1.6 billion dollars later.

If you want a brainless movie that doesn't provide much thought process, go for Jurassic World. I would just recommend re-watching it's predecessor, ""Jurassic Park"" to remind yourself the genius of Spielberg and not Trevorrow.",4
Jurassic World,"It's a bad movie that is semi-enjoyable on the big screen. i'm really glad i didn't watch this movie at home. it was predictable, boring, and really an average action/creature feature movie. i didn't like that they copied scenes from the first jurassic park. please do not buy this movie when it comes out on video, you will regret it",4
Jurassic World,"Good job Tv, media, government. You have finally done it i think. We as humans have officially become morons in the masses. Who cares about anything in a movie anymore? As long as it has good CGI hey? People rating this from 7-10 stars were either dropped on their head at birth or have spent their whole lives in front of the tube watching pure rubbish, making this seem good.

It fails on EVERY single level bar CGI. *Characters are complete idiots, bar Chris Pratts and what do they make him do? Train Velociraptors to help him fight the big bad dinosaur.. *Story. Yes it's Jurassic Park it doesn't need a great story after the first one, but anything is better than this.. *Acting, nothing memorable, not abhorrent but not overly good either, but hey how can you expect the actors to be memorable with those characters? *CGI. Top notch.

Hell that's a 10/10 right there..

To all those who rated this film 9 & 10/10. Thank you for degrading the intelligence of our species.

You idiots. You prove time and time again that you will watch anything with CGI. But hey throw in a master piece of an R rated film with violence and that's a horrible, disgusting movie..

You make me want to puke. D:

To hear people say they were on the edge of their seat for 2 hours.. just OMG. Leave your house more often..",4
Jurassic World,"Im glad i waited 3 years to watch this, i didnt miss a thing. it basically confirmed what i feared, its a monster movie with nonstop action and little to no story.

oh and the dopey genetically engineered hybrid indomimus or whatever it was called killed it for me. i know this is supposed to be sc-fi/action but that was a little overly goofy, i kinda tuned out and just laughed at the goofiness of whoever approved this script. acting was horrendous as well. particularly the two young boys - whos names i dont even remember cause they were so forgettable, also the 'claire' character was a robot. there was a scene where the boy claimed to have failed his driving test yet he proceeds to haul ass in a manual transmission jeep. lmao. this movie is a joke in more ways than one!

these actors had to be... they had to be robots? please tell me they were animatrons or cgi or something? no human being can be this bland lol. with the exception of owen, he was ok. do these characters return for fallen kingdom? if so i will flat out never watch that movie lol.

furthermore, seems like these movies regurgitate what the original jurassic park did; ill give the lost world some credit they did add a different perspective when they placed dinosaurs in our own backyards. i loved the scenes of the t-rex running in the middle of the street and roaming in peoples backyards, that was different that was cool. but these JW movies are so dopey and predictable and an obvious cash grab.

this is why the original jurassic park and lost world will always be the best installments in the franchise (change my mind). they told a good story and it was at the forefront of it all, they injected action into the mix just perfect and exactly where it was needed, they didnt just cram action scenes and cgi into every single scene.",4
Jurassic World,"The creative geniuses over at Hollywood have concocted yet another sequel to unnecessarily reprise a series. Jurasic World is full of cliches and scenes stolen straight from the original. Bryce is your stereotypical privileged city-girl who thinks she knows best because she is in a high powered career. But, at the end of the day she's just a woman and needs Pratt, the equally stereotypical, brawny, cowboy to swoop in and save her with his wilderness skills and masculineness. The brothers that are lost in the park are so generic I can't remember what they look like or anything that they did throughout the whole thing- and I just watched it. The main villain is a genetically altered dinosaur that's supposed to be new and exciting to tourists- but it pretty much just looks like a bigger T-Rex. It has a hodge-podge of powers like camouflage and heat detection, which it rarely uses and has super intelligence. Sure, its a hybrid of many types of dinosaurs but none of the dinosaurs that it was created from would be intelligent enough to create a sophisticated ruse in order to escape or know what a tracking device is. Then, it goes on a sadistic killing-spree for absolutely no reason except plot. Animals don't do this! Not even the really smart ones! Another thing that doesn't make sense: despite super dino roaming the island, determined to exterminate all life Bryce still refuses to evacuate because it may lose money for the park. This just makes her character feel false. She wouldn't be this cold, no way. All that being said, watching dinosaurs run around is just fun. No matter how senseless and forced the plot is dinosaurs are awesome and seeing them on screen will always be entertaining. I love dinosaurs so much I'll give it a whole 4 stars.",4
Jurassic World,"So many thing where bad about this movie, such a simple plot, no depth in the characters, poor acting, unexplained plot turns and characters, silly gender biases (girl runs in the jungle in high heals and the man holds the gun) and not even that exciting despite a huge dinosaurs is chasing them. Can't believe I saw the whole thing.",4
Jurassic World,"This is one of those movies where you just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. How many times can they rehash the exact same plot where humans go into a dinosaur environment and get eaten by them? That formula got stale after the 2nd J.P. movie. And Bryce Dallas Howard's character in high heels outrunning a T-Rex??? Yeah, like I said just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.",4
Jurassic World,"I love the CGI , it was so awesome.

I like the directors idea that you can have happiness in life if you are not in control but actually that is the directors subjective thinking not a fact. You will not have happiness in life if you are not in control otherwise you are finding ways to live a shorter life , a life that you will never get ever again and only have one chance to live.

I like how this whole movie expresses the directors imagination of how the dinosaurs died but that is not how they died , not like dramatically like this. Dinosaurs died because of the tectonic plates moving (separating from one another) and volcanoes bursting which burned the dinosaurs. There were other things that killed the dinosaurs to not just the volcanoes and the separation of tectonic plates.",4
Jurassic World,"***** spoilers *****

watched Jurassic world today. all i want to say - Mr. Spielberg, enough of dinosaurs please! in the fourth installment we see an emotional angle of dinosaurs. velociraptors behave like tamed dogs and they also turn henchmen and fight against the i-rex for our hero. did i see a drop or two tears in their eyes in the climax scenes? our heroine - wow, she only wears high heals while being chased and also while fighting the beasts. the plot is comparable with any 70's Indian action movies whats next? a love story with a boy tyrannosaurus and a girl mosasaurus?",4
Jurassic World,"After 20 minutes, I found myself skipping ahead every now and then until something happened. I did this because the writing/dialogue was so bad. There are enough spoiler reviews, so no need to go into what this is about. To me, it was about a movie that really didn't need to be made.

Let's hope this is the last one in the series. I didn't even bother to check if it is because I wouldn't watch it anyway.

Some scenes were awesome. Some, like when the birds escape, are moronic. The ""hero"" saves the day by shooting down a few birds. Then the kids just stand out in the open while other birds fly nearby. So stupid. This, despite several areas they could have run inside out of danger. Save your money on this, people. Not worth it. Especially if you have seen the other Jurassic movies.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM isn't the bomb that some are making it out to be but at the same time there's no question that it's the weakest film in the series and that's really too bad because there was an interesting story here that director J. A. Bayona just couldn't reel in. It's really too bad because this very well could have been the best of the series but the lackluster direction and lack of suspense really ruined it.,1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I thought the Jurassic World second movie would be better than the first one, but it's just not what I expected it to be. I didn't even feel like I want to watch the whole movie. The whole talking scene is like more than half an hour and it,s too boring. I would give the first movie 8 out of 10 stars. But that won't happened in this second movie.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I know that me telling you that it's bad probably won't be enough to dissuade you from watching it out of pure curiosity, but if you have to choose between watching this in your comfy house with A/C or mowing the lawn at temperatures rivaling those on the sun's surface, you'll be glad to know that the latter will still be preferable. Ok, ok, it's not thaaaaat bad, but it's by no means deserving of a rating of 2. A rating of 1 is quite generous.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,From cloned dinosaurs and thrilling chases around a gigantc landscape with tons of suspence to cloned little girls and body-painted-toyota-supra dinosaurs doing nothing. Just don't.,1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Movie is really bad, unfortunately. Is about smart dinosaurs and most of the scenes are very predictably",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,This was simply a rehash of The Lost World only it was poor from the get go. Great effects as always and a nice little throw back to the original with the brachiosaurus rising up on its hind legs before being consumed by lava but other than that I'm sorry I rented it,1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,This film is terrible. I do not understand why people are scoring it 10/10. I fell asleep during it. It has no characters of note and no storyline. It probably doesn't deserve a 1 but due to the trolls goving it a 10 I had to act. The acting is dreadful and the story is horrific. I don't think I need to say more.,1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"This movie is terrible. The plot is not very good either.

The main protagonists actually brought more terror on the world than the dinosaurs they were trying to save. It's not really a good thing when you're rooting for the bad guys to succeed because they had more control of the dinosaurs in their possession and of course when the protagonists showed up, they didn't solve any problems but create more for the world.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,One of the most cliched corny poorly written/directed movies I have seen in a very long time. Even the bad prequel before it was 100 times better.,1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"As a comedy for kids 5y/o+ to 13y/o is ok....ridiculous motivation apout animals... are they kidding us or what? huge dinosaurs amongst us just because we love..... animals? my kids were laughing when i told them it was a huge success in box office....thats a pitty for our money, our time ....please someone could kindly explain what do they mean about a fallen kingdom? human kind has weapons that can destroy half the globe and weapon dealers were buying dinosaurs??????????ha hahaha...i think the producers thought we are idiots and we could go to the theatres to give them 1,5 billion....you know what? they were right!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"That's it. A movie for kids. There isn't even anything good. Not enough dinosaur action. Stereo type characters. From the first minute on, you will know what will happen next. Couldn't explain how disappointed I am.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Even for a science fiction, it is completely senseless.

Scientifically completely incorrect, even taken in consideration that it is a science fiction. Just one of the many sequels, how long can one squeeze a subject like this one?

Very over the top Holiwood nonsensically lame boring movie.

Sad to see a Jurassic park this lame and depressing.

Do not waste your time.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I feel like the scene of the Explorer from the original movie being incinerated by lava is the perfect metaphor for this movie as a whole.

This movie is just a bunch of memberberries strung together as thoughtfully as a pair of corded headphones that have been in a child's backpack for three years.

They even go as far to introduce a Hammond copy character for literally no reason. They make him look similar, cane included, and play the sick old billionaire. For literally no reason at all.

As someone who was 10 years old when the original movie was released, I feel physically sick from this attempt at a movie.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,This movie is a letdown. The budget looks and feels significantly less than the previous movies. Most of the movie took place either on a boat or in a house. What a pointless sequel.,1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Only The initial 4min delivered what you expect from this type of movie.and only there, bayona signature could be clearly seen. The remaining 2 hours is just pathetic chaos and stupidity. CGI in your face up to nausea , noises , shouts all over the place.all too Predictable .the sense of dread and amazement of the 1993 masterpiece has just vanished.shame on you spielberg for having produced and let that pile of waste hit theater .",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Trevorrow, Connolly and Bayona should stay away from film making for everyone's sake.

One dimensional characters (especially the antagonists), weak, non existent or forced-for-the-plot motives, scenes no one ever wanted to see, technical stupidity, character stupidity, physical stupidity... Nothing makes sense. And the things that do are as simple and calculable as a stick. Now that I think about it, the producers should never ever be allowed to make a movie ever again either. I mean how can you read the script and not notice how flawed it is in every single scene?! To Trevorrow especially: you've ruined the Jurrassic Park AND the Star Wars franchise. Please, PLEASE just quit! You are inept. Accept it and find another career. Or just take the money you earned, build a beach house, sip cocktails for the rest of your life, I don't care. Just never create a movie ever again. Please. Really please!",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"If you thought Jurassic World was bad, this movie makes it look like the Original Jurassic Park.

Predictable and cookie cutter plot No character development Action for the sake of action

Do yourself a favor and don't watch it.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Bad story Lazy writing Terrible performances Terrible cliches CGI was rough Predictable Boring The action scenes were all the same Watching the dinosaurs fight was like a match of Mortal Kombat,1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"They took the plot of Taken and applied it to dinosaurs.

I don't need to say anything else, except that the film could have been much better if Liam Neeson was in it.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,I fast forwarded to the end when i was about half way through. Basically this movie feels like a commercialized movie. The story line was poor and boring. Had many stupid moments where characters just make the stupidest decision to move the story along and create a disaster. Many obvious nostalgia elements to remind you about Jurassic Park 1. It was just a movie to make money/profit as its main focus and not to entertain and create a good story..,1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"First of all, the CGI feels like it has downgraded. The textures are quite bad. Second and most important, the scrip is awful and it gets worse and worse throughout the movie. The villains constantly do things for no reason (like remove the teeth from a dinosaur or firing a tutor just because) just to show how bad they are. The comedy scenes are added before super triggering scenes of dinossaus and other animals being physically tortured (which happens ALL THE TIME). And finally, during action scenes, the characters do crazy things to survive (like shooting a gun underwater, popping a glass with a knife, ""flying"" with a truck and now Cris Prat can controlany dinossaur). But it's pretty nostalgic, it makes you remember the old movies with amazing technique. PS: the movie isn't very diverse(not at all actually) whem it comes to social minorities.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Totally ruined the Jurassic park for me! Usually rampage starts when a system fails or some ones evil doings. In this one the heroes manage to get many killed and a smart kid who thinks it is best to hide under blanket, lets out all of the dinosaurs!! blood transfusion, surgery to remove a tiny bullet that is lodged on the skin of the giant, smiling dinosaur, cliches, super smart dinosaur which can find a window and then open it using the knob, oh my god it was so full of it!",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"The title says it all, this is not a Jurassic Park movie, but a class B dinosaur movie. The direction, the script, the performances, the effects, and a long etcetera, everything is sad to see and believe. I feel sorry to see how this franchise has degenerated.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Cutting straight to the point, this is the worst Jurassic Park film so far. Very predictable throughout. At least the first ""Jurassic World"" had some element of originality and creativity, where as this one did not and is arguably a ""rip off"" from the previous with many familiar scenes. It's is such a shame as it is tarnishing what was once a brilliant classic.",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Anything past the first film is just garbage trying to make money from the title, praying on small children wanting dinosour toys and t shirts, wasted a good part of my life seing this film when i could have been more entertained watching grass grow",1
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"A follow up that continues to fumble.

The characters are all so unbelievable and corny.

Bryce Dallas Howard? Sounds like some NFL player. She is so cardboard and forced.

This trash continues to run this reboot into the ground. The movie is a continuation of nonsense and garbage that the dished up in the previous.

The dinosaurs are spectacular and you have to appreciate that, some very interesting types. However that's the only real positive to take out of this.

Chris Pratt is another average guy that Hollywood tries to force in our face as some new age action hero front man however he just isn't that guy.",2
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I never got why people like this. Fallen Kingdom is just a simple cash grab, with zero vision and drive. The first Jurassic World movie wasn't wonderful as well, but it followed the dream of bringing John Hammonds theme park finally to live. It also introduced the gen splicing, that already destroyed the magic of bringing dinosaurs back to live, by creating just CGI Monsters. BUT at least it was a new interesting idea. Chris Pratt's Character had some charisma and the brothers adventure tour through the park had some heartwarming and nostalgic moments.

The Mosasaurus was cool as well, I guess.

The follow up is a catastrophe. A Basic uninteresting villain that kills his mentor without cause. A volcano eruption to explain, why we are not that miserable island (Why did they even build a theme park on island that dangerous). Wherever they need to bend the story they do it. So many plot holes.

But whatever. I never gave a %§$& about the clone story. They try to top their last clone project and gave me a raptor that smiles while luring someone in a cage. This isn´t a trash film it's just bad. They made dinosaurs monsters and don´t even realize that the criticism in the first film about people stop visiting jurassic park unless the dinosaurs get more teeth, so the gen-lab-guys ""tune"" the dinosaurs. The problem: It applies to the the production of the second movie as well. They don´t know anymore how too lure people into the cinemas, so they just give you more teeth. I could write far more words. About the new dull and uninteresting characters, the failing chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard and so on and so forth. I never watched dominion (the sequel) and DO NOT RECOMMEND to watch any of this or following entries of this franchise. Don't waste your time and money.

Distance yourself from people who like this movie :)",2
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Well, first of all worst Jurassic movie ever, I hardly can imagine how it could have been any worse. If you want to tell someone which was worst 2 hours in your movie life I suggest to watch it and I believe you'll remember it for rest of your life. Personally for me Fantastic Four remake was so called ""worst 2 hours"" but from today it is second in the list. While movie begins without any serious issues, in the middle it becomes boring and the end is extremely idiotic, I will avoid to mention anything specific, but I guess after couple of weeks this franchise will leave its fans feel disappointed, just like it did to me. Hope next chapter will fix all the issues. If you're going to see it have an attitude ""get ready for worst, expect the best"", it might help.",2
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Now these days a lot of movies struggle to find its one tone, it happens in a lot of movie. If I'm going to find an example that sets a good tone then will be most marvel movies, it knows that it self is a comic book movie, and it plays around it, not like DC movies. It is funny, but there are never jokes during the intense scenes. So back to this piece Jurassic shit, from the trailer I thought this is going to be more like a horror movie which I think it is good, but there are stupid jokes during the most intense scenes. So which one is it? Do you want me to be scared or be happy, because I really can't do that at the same time. This tech person which is the comedic relief of this movie, he is fking disgusting, he is the most annoying thing ever, every time he is about to die, he screams like a girl, and people will think it is funny, which is not btw.

The story doesn't make any sense, it keep saying that we should save the dinosaurs, but through out the entire movie I didn't find any reason that they should be alive! If I were them I just let all those things die, they are dangerous and expensive, and beside, humans will always make more even they shouldn't. This army guys is super annoying, and he let out the dinosaur is because he wants it tooth, like WTF! It doesn't make any fking sense! There are so many thing in this movie doesn't make any sense that take me out of the movie so many times.

Every time this movie try to build up tension it failed, you need time to make the audience to be scared, but every time it falls short or ends it with a stupid joke. And it is so obvious what is going to happen that if you make a prediction it probably gonna happen, so you feel no tension at all, you don't worry about them, if I don't worry about them, then why should I care AT ALL?

Everything in this movie is lazy, the cinematography is lazy, the script is lazy, the actors clearly doesn't give a shit. The only scene that is not lazy is the scene where they collect the T. rex's Blood, which they use practicle affect, which means they make an actual dinosaur head, that scene looks very real and natural because there is some thing for the actor react to, and I very much appreciate that, but rest is total dog shit, the shot composition have no meaning at all, out of the entire movie, there are only two shots I like, and I only can remember one of them.

So yea, don't watch it, unless you are so bored and have nothing else to do.",2
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Cannot stress enough how much I did not like this movie. Did not like the plot or the storyline at all.

The effeminate nerd who I wanted dead the whole movie and fiesty ""independent"" woman who doesn't need a man. The villain is the cookie cutter type. Then there is the little girl who is just an idiot.

The plot is crap you would find in a Saturday morning cartoon. Yet again the movie involves scientists creating another genetically engineered dinosaur. Only the first act of the movie takes place on the island. The rest is in a mansion. Not only is the plot cartoony but the action is as well.

The ending, oh boy. The ending is the cherry on top of this terd.",2

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"The movie was pretty average, but I did enjoy Isabella Sermon as Maisie. She was very expressive and adorable. I also thought that there was a passion to her performance and indefinite charm that she posessed.

One thing that stood out me was the scene where she is with her grandfather, James Cromwell and and she asks, "" Do I look like my mother?"" ""Oh, Yes,"" He replies And she gives the most amazingly adorable smile ever. It's a very charming, attractive smile.

Overall, she was the saving grace of an otherwise forgettable movie.

If they ever make a film adaptation of The Chessmen of Mars, Isabella Sermon should play Princess Tara.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"SPOILER: So they only had Jeff Goldblum in the movie to preach to us? Was hoping at some point the socially inept millennial and the SJW dino vet would be eaten. Oh and the big reveal, the little girl is a clone. Sniffed that one out immediately. Chris Pratt is the only reason to watch this dumpster fire.",2
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Horrible plot. Horrible plot holes. Very disappointed. Got bored halfway through.,2
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,This movie is so stupid and boring. The characters don't matters for me in this movie and the only positive thing was Chris Pratt.,2
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Again casting makes no sense. Most of the characters lack charisma and chemistry with each other. Pineda makes no sense in the role as the constant b*tchy and annoying and dislikable character surely put in there to please the feminist. Bryce Dallas is clearly out of shape for this physically demanding role. Chris pratt again has bore and dull acting and the story line is boring. Like the last film in which casting made no sense ( having Irfan khan as the head of the park made no sense he was clearly out of place and was put in there for indian movie watchers). I really hope they don't make anymore movies.,2
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I loved the previous movie, but this was crap tbh. Apart from a decent scène here and there, this movie was so boring and bland. The plot is awefull and the big bad uber dino was just silly, especially its name.... Some horrible emotional scenes that were just cringeworthy.... how anyone can rate this a good movie is beyond me, and im not a very critical viewer at all! Stay clear is my advice",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Genuinely disappointed. If the agenda was to cram as many dinosaurs into one film as possible with a ridiculous reason why then they clearly don't appreciate the heritage of these films. Just action with no real focus on the characters. Why wasn't Ian Malcom deeply involved.,3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"This movie is a serious let down from it's predecessor.

Taking the grand scale that Jurassic Park and Jurassic World capitalized on and shoving it into a shoebox, aka Mansion is a serious misstep. All the trailers lead you to believe that the movie will have at least a large chunk take place in the wrecked park. This is not the case, in fact, it seems like they are trying to get off the island as fast as they can write into the ship's rear view mirror. The estimated budget was $170 million. What did they spend it on? The majority of the movie is shot in the same setting, a mansion. The movie also feels like it was written from the aspect of, ""We need to release the dinos into the world and spend 2 hours doing it."" and they just started writing the story knowing the end point and working backwards. I can only hope Steven Spielberg tightens the reigns on 3 and finishes this trilogy strong.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"This is the worst Jurassic movie This movie actually got me kinda mad Like it was a fun time But it's so stupid Good things -Chris Pratt -Dinosaurs Bad things -Jeff goldblum has no purpose of being there and shows up for 5 minutes total in the very beginning and very end -the new characters don't really add to the plot and feel like wastes and also unfunny and annoying -the ending is some of the biggest bs I've seen in a movie in a long time, and the reason behind the bs is because of something a certain character says that is so dumb -the ending was the way it was so they could just hype up another Jurassic movie -""Dinosaur Lives Matter"" -the reasoning for some things characters do in this movie is stupid -and finally overall the plot is just kinda the same as Lost world if you think about it, an even worse version of it If you wanna laugh at something stupid Go watch Jurassic world 2 4.5/10",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I went into this movie expecting it to be dumb fun. I was half right: this movie is dumb. Basically this movie suffers from other big-budget movies where you can tell different scenes were produced by different teams and then sort of glued back together in what was supposed to be a cohesive movie but winds up feeling like the main actors are in 5 different shorts about dinosaurs.

Yes, there's a ""plot"" that loosely ties things together but the end result wound up as a combination of ""didn't work"" and ""I don't care"".

At least the dinosaurs looked good!

Standard review formula below. Acting: * Writing: Direction: Production Value: ** ""It"" factor:",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Good special effects as always, but the plot incomprehensibly silly",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,The film lacks an interesting story line and then tries too hard to make up for it with references to the original Jurassic Park. Subpar performances from decent actors who appear to be mailing it in for a check. Skip this installment of Jurassic Park,3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"""Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan."" -Job 3:8

Problems with Jurrassic world 2 are repeating the same flaws of StarWars VIII
disregard for the existing world building
actively rewriting the history
weakly formed philosophical standpoint
insufferable comic reliefs
straw-men antagonists
ridiculous choices from characters and dinosaurs
embarrassing choices from film-makers
this film quickly becomes a parody of itself and falls flat on it's back with nobody to pick it up 3/10",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Boring, predictable, not worth watching. This movie continuously made me look at my watch to see if it was almost over.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Literally the first 2 to 3 minutes in and I thought here we go again another couple of hrs of my life gonna be wasted here. Clutching at straws with this one, it's like they just completely ran out of ideas. Soo predicable soo clique and not for kids viewing either in my opinion.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"If the first Jurassic World proved that we can clone Spielberg movies, this one proves we can clone the crappy sequels too. The only difference is a worse script, way too much cgi, and the most annoying version of Chris Pratt I have ever seen. He manages to smirk even while outrunning lava and dinosaurs. (Also, he is a world class swimmer!) The action sequences here might have been fun on a big screen, but they can't save the island - or the movie - from imploding.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"The Structure in JW2 is explained by the actors instead of the story driving the narrative. This is done with bclunky lines delivered by barely capable acting. What happened to Bryce Dallas Howard's Character's personnel? She was a strong bad ass CEO, now she is a confused tourist who knows little about the park she helped build.

I would write more but I am too sad to continue, Jurassic Park was an incredible breakthrough film this is just a copy of a copy of a copy of a..",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Wow. This film was so bad. Plain and simple there is zero enjoyment to be had watching this movie. The characters are not interesting and the story is boring. The worst part was the two new suporting actors (make & female) their characters were so annoying I was just praying they would get eaten by a dinosaur.,3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Fellas at Universal apparently decided to make at least 10 episodes of Jurassic Park/World/you name it. And this one is just paving the way for what is coming. Everything is mediocre and boring. It is the last episode of this franchise I've watched for sure.,3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I would give 1 star but I laughed, out loud and by myself, at every stupid desicion made by the characters. It's so bad I even laughed at the cheesy b.s.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"In brief: Dinosaurs? Awesome, as always. People dealing with dinosaurs? Ridiculous. ""Plot""? LUDICROUS!! What a sad wheeze this franchise has become, in spite of the dino's. PLEASE STOP....just, stop. Took an amazing concept and have literally, completely, soiled it.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"SPOILER: While summer blockbusters are not the thought intensive movies you would typically expect. Jurassic World 2 is to lazy writing as light beer is to a drunk, inseparable. From your typical jungle mercenaries set on betraying our protagonist, to the redesigned 'indo-rapter' (really?) - the movie digs deep into film cliches from the 90s; to perhaps create an incubator for nostalgia? If that is so, the movie is right on the target, because the amount of fan service gets to a point where you go ""okay, we get it.""

From raptors hunting in museums, to our ever present 'Rexy' the T-rex (how convenient it is for a blood thirsty carnivore to always be there whenever help is needed, and for it to scoot along out of scene without leaving a single scratch on our protagonist; remember we're talking about a 3000 pound carnivore here). Dinosaurs running in plains with our protagonist; raptors opening doors, that one scene with the goat?

A nod to old times would have been a pleasant gesture, but this... this is an ad for Jurassic Park.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Rubbish, good comedy though. Bet this didn't do the ""stars"" any favours.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Dinosaure crying!!! They just blew it this sequel just broke the hall jurassic films it shouldnt exist its full of crap and all the effects... its looks like low budjet movie the dinosaures dont look real boring movie .. its even doest have a real plot or a story. No mattar how much i well write here u wont know what i mean untill you well see the movie.,3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"As it might make for a better story than this tired excuse for yet another sequel. Been there, seen it before really does apply to this one. If this franchise is going to keep going, please, please come up with a new plot. And one that actually makes a bit of sense and doesn't have terrible plot holes in it.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Coming out of the movie I had the distinct feeling of ""6"". This movie really seems like a 6/10 movie. Ya know the expression no one trains for second place... well this film feels like it was training for forth. The first Jurassic World was far from a GREAT movie but it was the best Jurassic movie we've had since the original and I saw a lot of potential moving forward. And Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom did the same thing The Lost World did, it dropped the ball and stared at it... except this time they are only half way up the hill. Their are a lot of things I like about the movie such as the use of flashing light to foreshadow a looming dangerous creature, the effects are slightly better, it was suspenseful (except in the third act where it fell into over used horror movie tropes), and the ideas of more dino experimentation was cool... that's about it. The way they tried to make the movie into a horror/action flick was really stupid, like if you're going to have this dinosaur- this killing machine chase this little girl or tool in this case, throughout the house just so you can have the dinosaur follow her into her bedroom to stick its claw out at her while she is under her covers is just pathetic. Great reuse of the last films ending Jurassic World I'm sure I won't notice. This film dropped the kids from the previous film for unlikable teen scream machines, say whatever you want about the kids in the previous movie but I at least cared about them and didn't find them irritating, the teens they used in this movie were just terrible from their ear piercing screaming to their terrible line delivery made watching them a choir. Let's recap in the last movie you had the I-Rex which is built up to be the killing machine of the T-Rex times 10 but it is defeated in 10 minutes by one T-Rex and a lonesome Raptor because they backed it close enough against the railings of a tank... fine. But you mean to tell me that when they do the same thing again but made sure to take all the best aspects of the two most legendary killers of world history that the I-raptor is killed by one singular velociraptor (who is infamous for being weaker alone than in groups/packs) and Chris Prat (who's character has become extremely disinteresting in this movie) because he was able to move away fast enough... I call bs. Is it the worst movie I've seen this year? NO, I've seen much worse. Is it a stupid summer blockbusters meant to be watch with your brain turned off and to sell toys? Yes, and as that... it does its job fine

(p.s. If you thought they were going to let the dinosaurs die at the end of the movie you should have thought back to when the studio announced THREE Jurassic Park movie. Sit back because we still have one more film as of now. After the next one I'll be Jurassiced out for a while...)",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I'm actually kinda torn: is this the worst Jurassic Park movie or does that honor still belong to The Lost World? I can't answer that question at the moment, but I can talk about the new one. First of all, there are some positives. The section of the movie on the island is great. It's exactly what I wanted to see after watching the trailer. Lot's of explosions, lots of action, lots of dinosaurs: it's pretty cool. The score's also good, but that can be expected. I don't think I really had too many problems with the dialogue other than the fact that there was some forced humor. But it didn't make me cringe at any point, so it's not too much of a problem. Also, Chris Pratt was fine. That's unfortunately about all the positives I can bring to the table, because now we have to talk about the awful plot.

I will keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but I simply have to talk about the plot setup.

The film begins with some people who are working on Isla Nublar in order to find an Indominus tooth so they can extract its DNA. And some of them get eaten. Because of course they do. Then, we cut to Claire, the park manager in the last movie, working as a dino-rights activist (no, I'm not kidding). It makes even less sense when you remember that this same character explicitly DIDN'T care if the dinos had rights or not in the last movie. But now, she's basically the leader of PETA for Dinos, or PETD for short. The issue is that a volcano is about to erupt on Isla Nublar and kill every dinosaur that was ever created. Whoever wrote this movie must've forgotten about the other island that had dinosaurs on it: the one that was in The Lost World and Jurassic Park III. Then there are some court hearings with Jeff Goldblum testifying why Hammond made a huge mistake by creating dinos in the first place and why they should let the dinos die. And he's totally right; it's almost like the movie is self-aware in that aspect. However, Claire cares so deeply about the dinos that she joins a team of people that supposedly want to bring the dinos to a safe island. Supposedly. But silly, naive Claire says yes without asking any questions and drags Chris Pratt into it because otherwise, his velociraptor named Blue will die. But surprise surprise! The people that hire them are greedy and try to leave them for dead. However, our heroes manage to escape and follow the crooks to the mansion of a guy who worked with Hammond (yet was never mentioned in any of the other movies). And that's were the rest of the movie takes place.

I just described what felt like a third of the movie. Meaning the final two thirds of the movie take place in a mansion.

A movie called Jurassic WORLD is confined to the space of a mansion.

So that's what I can say about the plot without spoiling it, because most of what I just said was in the trailer. There's more weird stuff in this movie that I'd like to talk about, but you can just see them for yourself if you do enjoy this series. Trust me, I haven't even scratched the surface. There is a plot twist that is going to make you scratch your head in confusion because it comes out of nowhere and makes absolutely no sense.

Now let's talk about the characters, another major problem with this movie. One of the original's biggest strengths was the character development. It was something that actually allowed you to care what happened to the characters and empathize with them. In Fallen Kingdom there seems to be three types of characters in this movie, which is not enough distinguishable personalities for these characters to be interesting. I classify these types are as follows: underdeveloped hero, dinosaur meal, and annoying, screaming baby that almost kill the underdeveloped heroes. Chris Pratt and Claire are the underdeveloped heroes that you don't hate, but honestly don't give a rip about. Chris Pratt generally does a great job with making his roles very likable, but he had to make do with the script that was given to him. Claire was never a great character to begin with, but she was at least tolerable in the last one. However, she isn't in this one. Again, I don't blame the actress, because I think Bryce Dallas Howard can be a great when you give her a good script to work with (just watch The Help and The Village for proof). Her character is just so, so bad. Then we have the ""dinosaur meal"" characters. You know, the ones that you just look at and know are gonna be eaten by a dino. Of course, they have even less development than the thinly developed heroes. And now let's get to my absolute favorite type of character in this movie (not really): whiny, loud, obnoxious, screaming sidekick. There's two of these that I can specifically think of in this film. One is scared of all thing dino-related, yet works for PETD and decides to fly to an island full of dinos. And yes, whenever one is in eyeshot, he shrieks his mind out. Sounds like an annoying kid character right? Well this is actually a grown man. But don't worry: there's an annoying kid character too! There's this little girl (who is essential to the plot) who actually puts whoever she's with in even more danger then they are already in because she screams and attracts the attention of anything around her. I'm pretty sure there are other types of characters I didn't mention, but that's because I forgot them and didn't care enough to remember.

This film did not work for me. It might work for other Jurassic Park fans, but I personally did not like it. It really feels like the studio is trying to milk the Jurassic Park formula and if they keep making them at this quality, they're gonna have some trouble. I can only recommend this to Jurassic Park fans, the only people who I can see enjoying this. But keep in mind that I identify as one of those and still thought it was bad. Well, at least I didn't buy a ticket.

In my humble opinion, the best thing for the Jurassic Park franchise at this point in time is to go extinct.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Idk how one can rate this a 9 or 10, except they do not rethink a single second from this movie.

The story is predictable, and very poorly written!

What's the matter with clone girl? She does nothing to the story, and seems only to be there for one of the last (very stupid) scenes.
And you can clearly tell she's a clone from the first moment she appears, as its permanently stated how she's exactly resembling her mother, her mother who died in an accident, and her ""grandfather"" who likes to have her around (in the mansion with the big secret clone laboratory in the basement) etc.. Much too obvious!

The whole auction is about the introduction of the ""Indo-Raptor"" as a prototype-""War-Dino"".
But they're selling mostly ""normal"" dinos. WHY would a warlord spend millions to have a uncontrollable, hard to transport and hard to maintain monster in the barn? It also can be easily killed by enough (and much cheaper) firepower. In addition the actual War-Dino miserably fails at killing people. Btw: ""War-Dinos"" were a thing when I was 6 or so and watching animated series from the 80s & 90s.

I can't believe that even in this fictional world can be a rational thought about setting dinos free on populated mainland (in sense of ""save the dinos"").
Since this is not a remake or so, but a sequel to all the happenings from JP and the first JW, we know that DINOS + HUMANS = DESASTER!!! They literally proved it several times. So it is just ridiculous where Claire has a hard time to decide about opening the gate. And of course it's clone girl who finally pushes the button (for some stupid ""they're clones, like me""-reason), because that's the only scene why she even exists.

And the list goes on. This movie is just a joke. Don't watch it!",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Do i really need to add a longer review just repeating how terrible she and this movie are?,3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"When I sat down in the cinema I told myself: I bet there's going to be a scene where a character is being chased down by a dinosaur near a cliff but at the last moment a helicopter will save him just in time to be destroyed by something else afterwards. I was right, it literally happened in the first scene! The rest of the movie was just poor and horrendous filled with plot conveniences such as: getting saved at the last moment before drowning, hackers can unlock everything by just smashing the keyboard, bad guy killed in the dullest way but satisfying to watch etc... The plot was just weak. One thing that I like to address is that at the beginning there's the scene where the government refuses to save the dinosaurs which is reasonable because the dinosaurs are literally in another country so the US has no business to do with it. This is perceived by the protagonist and her friends like it was a bad decision made by some kind of evil administration. (Like the media depicts today any decision made by the current US administration). So the protagonist and her friends go on a crusade against the people who decided to not save the dinosaurs and join this rich guy who promises to save the dinosaurs. They kinda deserved all the bad things that happened to them during the film like this is what you get if you don't listen to people that have probably more wisdom and experience than you. This is basically teaching to all the kids that watched the movie that it is ok to go against the law and the people who made it and implying that everything that the government does it's bad. Honestly, the protagonist would have deserved to perish in the ashes of the volcano.",3
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I like Jurassic World; it has a semi-interesting plot, and the action is good enough. This film, on the other hand, is just plain awful. The plot is ridiculous. Hardly any dinosaur action. The plot starts naff and ends up a million miles away.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"When a little girl, who is portrayed as smart and adventurous, hides under the sheets while the Indominus slowly hover towards her in a Freddy Crugiesque Fashion, you know there is something seriously wrong with this movie! I really missed those kids from the first movie!

The movie started fine but then it spiralled out of control. From dark and misterios it went to plan silly as soon as they left the island.

The Indominus roaring on top of the mansion while on hunt mode is quite ridiculous. What animal alerts it's prey in this way?

There are many things that simply don't make sense and make you switch off. Like minutes before the anticlimac death of Indominus, when it is chasing after Chris Pray on the glass dome and Bryce tries to distract it but then directs the Indominus back at Chris with the laser! I was like, what? Why didn't yo point at something else? What was the point of that?

Or when at the end of the movie, instead of opening the exterior doors to ventilate the room and get rid of the toxic fums, they release the dinosaur first and then let them escape!

I was expecting much more, I had high hopes with Bayona but it's been the worst of them all, unfortunately.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,You can watch but not a masterpiece maybe you will be bored if you are looking for a good film it isnt right place,4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"""The Park Is Gone"" is the log line for this, being the 5th entry in the film series, based upon Michael Crichton's novel, ""Jurassic Park"" - Steven Spielberg directed the first two installments, where due to a greedy computer programmer looking sabotaged the park, in an attempt to flee with a shaving cream can full of dinosaur embryos, during a storm. His escape attempt, unwittingly deactivated all the safety measures and the cloned dinosaurs run amok, as the first few guests must flee for their lives. And the second film, ""The Lost World"" followed a venture onto Site B, where the Dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, were being raised before moving to the main park on a separate island, to bring some dinosaurs to a new San Diego based park. The lackluster Jurassic Park 3 involved rescuing someone's son, who trespassed to the Site B island. The film franchise lay dormant for over a decade, until Colin Trevorrow, director of ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" was offered to helm a reboot / return to Pre-Cambiran theme park. Trevorrow brought some big ideas, which, largely meant ignoring all but the first film, and weirdly, ostracizing it. In 2015's Jurassic World, a parks system operator, played by Jake Johnson, gets chastised by his boss, Bryce Dallas Howard's ""Claire"" for wearing a 'vintage' Jurassic Park shirt, while working the renovated park, that still bore many holdovers and shoddy homages to the original. In the Jurassic World timeline, shortly after the events of the first film, a new investor began to work with John Hammond to fix and open the park, though apparently under a different name, where it has been running for over 10 years, updating features, rides, and various other experiences as the technology became available. Jurassic Park was already on the cutting edge in 1993, Jurassic World, in 2015 was on the bleeding edge, well beyond the quaint Thinking Machines and Super Computers.

Fallen Kingdom, takes place 3 years after the events of Jurassic World, where a genetically modified 'designer dinosaur' managed to escape its enclosure and run amok through the park, because it just so happened to have enough of a little bit of every other kind of dinosaur, that it could control them. The MacGuffin-o-saurus could do anything and everything and was mean and smart and bloodthirsty and was, with 3 years of hindsight, boring to have such an over powered engine of pure malice. Jurassic World was a huge success at the box office, and the producers got Colin Trevorrow on to write the next two films, he was originally slated to direct Star Wars Episode 9, after Jurassic World, but had made a smaller film called ""The Book of Henry"" which, performed so poorly, and with the post-honeymoon conversations about Jurassic World not having the legs J.P. had, made Lucasfilm doubt Trevorrow was a directorial golden boy, and pulled the Star Wars film from him, and gave it to JJ Abrams. Trevorrow had also passed the torch to direct a Jurassic World sequel off to J.A. Bayona, the disciple of Guillermo Del Toro, whom had directed 2009's The Orphanage, 2012's The Impossible and 2016's ""A Monster Calls."" Bayona proved himself to be a powerful visual storyteller, though still had to play in Trevorrow's sandbox, as he was still the writer and an Executive Producer.

Fallen Kingdom, falls short of being its own movie, and is more a remake of The Lost World than anything, with a group of goons led by a 'great white hunter' played by Ted Levine (The Silence of The Lambs), working for John Hammond's previously non-existent business partner, who wanted to rescue as many dinosaurs as possible, since Isla Nublar, where Jurassic Park/World is/was, faces a fiery volcanic destruction, any day now. Survivors from Jurassic World, Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt must go back to rescue ""Blue"" Pratt's pet Velociraptor, whom he had trained, and was the only person who could get close enough to the dino to offload her from the the island. Pratt's ""Owen"" tracks the Raptor down to, the same site, where, 25 years earlier, an electric Jurassic Park Ford Explorer had been knocked off its track and hurled into a tree by the T.Rex. Once out in the open, the Raptor gets tranq'd and we curse the sudden, yet inevitable betrayal by the Hunter and his horde, and we find out that Lockwood (James Cromwell)'s assistant Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) has no intention of relocating the dinosaurs to a safe haven, but to auction them off to a cabal of ridiculous rejected Bond Villains. The film is half, disaster porn and half sneaking around a mansion, but can't help borrowing heavily from The Lost World at every turn.

The Story is by far the weakest of any Jurassic film, but attempts to open get the scope of the future films off the Island, and increase the dinosaur presence around the world and attempts to play philosophical with the ethics of do the dinosaurs deserve to live and even gets into the troublesome area of human cloning. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a ride at Universal, rather than its own film, as none of the stakes have any teeth, despite the constant threat of toothed carnivores. There are some fun moments, but they are far outnumbered by stupid sequences. I don't blame J.A. Bayona for the dull moments of the film, he's able to create some truly spectacular, impossible shots that must have taken months to render, because they were clearly shot in some green screen prison. The story also drags its feet by retreading the 'designer dinosaur' angle, this time with an ""Indio Raptor"" a smaller version of the ""Indominous Rex"" - The film's timeline, and even the dinosaurs felt inconsistent between shots, the iRaptor varied wildly from the size of a large horse to almost elephantine size, and then small enough to fit through a door.

I went in wanting to like this movie, but i had more problems with it, than i could set aside and attempt to enjoy it. And rather than continue the path these films are on, Frank Marshall (the Producer) should take a queue from his wife Kathleen Kennedy (Head of Lucasfilm) and remove Colin Trevorrow from any future films, and also look at how Sony handled ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" films, and just sweep the Jurassic World Franchise under the rug, and start over. It doesn't necessarily matter if a film makes money, if it hurts the IP, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom hurts the Jurassic Franchise.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Riddled with far too many coincidences. Frankly, it was insulting to my intelligence. The main reason I didn't give it a lower rating is because it had a few chuckles and decent action. Other than that, it sucked. At least I didn't have to pay for it.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I found the film to be incredibly frustrating. We see yet another reboot from a great franchise that ruins what the great films originally were. I liked the first Jurassic world, but many parts of that movie were rediculous (oh my god it speaks raptor!). now they are adding human clones and having dinosaur arms dealer auctions in the basement of their rich friend's house (who somehow has no idea they made a gene splice dinosaur baby in a secret lab 3 floors down. This movie basically tells me not to trust my accountant, and to let dinosaurs into America to run rampid no matter how many people they kill (who needs a wall anyways right?) They also never explain how the accountant planned to make all these millions, when he was working FOR the millionare (who he just smothered with the stereotype throw pillow). The money would end up going to the granddaughter clone who was thrown aggressively on the floor after being caught snooping in her own house (does CYS protect clones?). Over all the movie is setting up to be a dinosaur based rip off of planet of the apes. They could do way better with that cast, instead they used Chris Pratt as a cutaway comic relief man who also does karate all of a sudden to distract from a movie that absolutely had no substance.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Besides the scenes of interactions with Blue as a young pet size raptor which is adorable. And several exactly and shots &scenes are tribute to the very first Jurassic Park. The script only could fool an 8 year old... Too many holes and unexplainable plots.

BIG WASTE of all the time the whole crew had put in, and the amount of $$$ should be used in other productions!",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"The story itself is a bit generic. They did nothing new or risky, just sticked to the formula. Which ends up in an entertaining movie while also being predictable and sometimes annoying.

Don't set your bars too high and you will find this entertaining.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"This was a bad script with no direction, poorly paced, unoriginal concepts taken from previous movies, horrible and annoying millennial characters, smart arse feminist and cuck male who screens, why not kill them with lava, that would have been fun. For the budget the sets and look of the film seemed fine, it's just the story was a total pile of steaming TRex poo.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"I had a couple of hours to kill, so decided to check out Jurassic World:Fallen Kingdom. I can still remember the thrill of watching the original Jurassic Park which was ground breaking for visuals at the time. Unfortunately for Fallen Kingdom that is no longer the case and the movie really seemed to be stuck abiding by the same formula as all the Jurassic movies.

The one thing that is different in Fallen Kingdom is the total lack of suspense throughout the movie. This is a distinct step backwards from Jurassic World which was all together more entertaining. Whilst the leads, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, do their best there is no getting away from the clunky plot that we've seen before. If anybody ever ends up with Jurassic box set this is one of the movies which will be played once and then shelved. Definitely one to wait for small screen and then watch whilst surfing the web.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Same genetic modification, same sort of bad guys trying to sell off the creatures. Yawn..",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"It's still a good thing the fate i did not watch this movie in the theater. From what I saw in the trailer I did not expect anything from this sequence, I soon realized that it would be a disaster. And it really was. Ridiculous and weak story worthy of a tv movie. Do not these writers really know how to write something real that makes sense? The new characters are boring and uninteresting to the point that you want their death. Jeff Goldblum appears on the scene to say an environmentalist speech (how much lack of imagination). In this film the character of Chris Pratt lost his charisma, turning into a stupid white male(It became the new trend). As the character of Bryce Dallas Howard suddenly changed his personality into a dinosaur-loving activist, it sounded so fake and unlikely (Live to feminism). Everything in this walking confusion made me laugh. Good thing I did not spend money on that !!! Hollywood will still continue to produce these mediocre movies ... giving its audience meaningless action and jokes without graces. I miss it when there were movies made with the heart. This was made to profit and does not excite, captivate or mark someone's life. Unfortunately this Jurassic World is more to be forgotten and locked.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Good Lord, this movie is terrible.

I was not a fan of the first Jurassic World. That's putting it mildly. I hated it. It made me angry. And sad. It was such a lazy, cynical, cliche, SyfY level remix of one of my favorite films of all time.

There are some things that Fallen Kingdom does better than it's predecessor. The action is better, the cinematography actually looks like a theatrical film rather than low budget straight to video junk. And the pacing is better...well at least its faster. The problem with Jurassic World was that the first 45 minutes were really slow and boring. The problem with Fallen Kingdom is it moves waaay too fast. The rescue mission on the exploding island, which was advertised as being the bulk of the film, is over in the first 30 minutes. The film then very suddenly becomes a different film. A film about weapinizing dinosaurs and selling them to the highest bidder. Then the film just becomes a basic monster in the house chase movie. There's 3 different movies in this movie and none of them are given the proper time to develop into anything.

This movie is just a collection of half-baked, unexplored ideas. The film raises philosophical and ethical questions to give the appearance of depth and then doesn't ever address them again. The movie is basically just half-assedly recycling themes from black mirror and calling that intelligent.

The film also reuses just about every iconic shot and moment from every previous Jurassic Park, but not in a way that's exciting or enjoyable, it just feels lazy.

And without spoiling anything, the film has an absolutely ludicrous ending that is brought on in the most forced way imaginable.

Please just stop making these. Please.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Sorry, but this Movie was deffinetly a complete Dissapointing Nightmare! You can say. The Trailer of the Movie showed in core the BEST of the whole Movie. Rest you can complete forget. Jeff Goldblum recieved a nice side Role, close to Cameo, what could had been complete cutted away. For the Story simple way, as they needed to get time filled or simple the Character name in. What ever. He was deffinetly not needed inside this Movie.

Then, the whole movie screams out to be a kind of bit overworked story of Jusrassic Park 2 and 3. Extreme too much Chris Prat. Whas here a problem of Possible Budget cuts? That over 80 % of the story was Prat her, Prat there... . The Island Rescue... come on... was that meant as Joke or really that way? About Travel on the Island, one road driving, some dino camshots, computer room and Bang... "" Days of Dino Capture work "" done in feeld 5 minutes. And oo wow run run, the Vulcan blows up like nothing... without warning sensors and such things at a Island computer controll system, what was equipped State of art with about everything... . Extreme Logic hole! Rest then on the House... some how complete all Idiotic. Not only the Auction... too the part.. Hey! The Dinos broke already out of 2 Max. Security Parks. Last time the Travel Back was Guarded by a fully high armed and in fully alarm Navy Fleet. Then too, the other Island.. complete forgotten, that it exist?

Sorry , but what Star Trek 1 ( 11 ) in the Star Trek line was... the Same happened now with Jurassic Park. The Worst Movie now from line of 5!

4 Stars only because its a nice Movie, for Popcorn and switch brain off. But hell dont expect too much. Only something for easy entertainment.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Okay, so I watched this movie from start to finish and I hope they are finished making this movie, but they are not, there were to many Dinosaurs running loose at the end, but I did up my rating from a one star to four, it would have gotten a ten if Nick Robinson had been a co-star. The movie did have its moments, just wasn't enough of them and to many unanswered questions. If you are looking for a way to waste a couple hours watch this movie if you know someone who has it, I wouldn't buy it, but then to this a personal matter of choice. I JURASSIC WORLD is more like JURASSIC BORING now. 6 movies and no end insight.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"That basically sums up the positive there is to say about this movie. Quite funny - But not when it wants to be. It is not supposed to be a parody on jurassic park. But it seems that way. Moments of good acting as well though.

So many errors and flaws. No original ideas. Big time failing in the script. Not true to the storylines of previous films from the jurassic movies. Too much horror and blood.

But all that said... Definitely not among the worst movies I've seen.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"How can movie with so many action scenes be this boring? For the last hour i just prayed ""please be over"". Everything is so predictable and action scenes just follows another. First half is OK, there is real tension but then non-stop action just goes way over the top. Haven't film makers heard that orgasm is nice, but when it lasts for two hours, everyone is just waiting it to end?

I just feel like i watched two hours of non-stop dinosaur fighting for some reason.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"This movie has a bland plot, it ends with a bland speech as if all the world is overrun by dinosaurs while it's at most 20. Of which some got caught, as the film even shows. The cgi is about a million times better than the story and acting, for which I give 4 stars. The rest is just not worth it. There are terrible oneliners, a geek that doesn't like nature and is afraid, a nerdy girl that is beautiful but dresses like a nerd, the evil people have absolutely no depth or any basic brain functionality. As if auctioning rare dinosaurs will give you more money than just fundraising for research while also just asking for prepayment or investments to anyone wanting a killer dino. Don't even watch this, just go and watch the Jurassic Park or the first Jurassic World. Hell, go and see The Expendables, at least that movie isn't so pretentious.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"It was quite a good film, and I might even say it was better than the last. It had quite A Lost World feel to it at the start, experts hired to find dinosaurs on the island while 'hunters' were there to capture them and take them to the mainland.

Why did they keep saying the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar were the last of thier kind, what happened to the other island from Jurassic Park 2 and 3?

I liked the idea of the new genetic creation, the indoraptor, but at times it seemed a bit far fetched: when the hunter shot tranquilliser darts at it in the auction how did the indoraptor know to pretend to be asleep? Then chasing Owen and co in the house, they climbed the winding stairs and the indoraptor, which was only able to get its head on the upper floor, somehow then managed to scrabble it's way up? And again on the roof it nearly fell through but saved itself despite having only two claws in the metal railing? It all seemed unlikely. And how it was able to track the girl by climbing over the roof seemed questionable.

How they killed the indoraptor was a bit too much like the last film, Blue fighting off a dinosaur larger and stronger than it, at least we didn't get the tag-team of raptor and txrex. Then again we had the parting where Blue ran away into the trees, I wouldn't have been too surprised to see it give Owen a hug! A big dangerous predator suddenly acting sedate and gentle!?

With that ending of the dinosaurs free in the world it leaves a good opening for a sequel, but I hope this time they give genetics a break, it's been done and they always have nature win no matter how big and powerful the creation is.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"This movie can be condensed into a trailer for the, more than obvious, next movie. Rip off. Disappointing in camparison to all others.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,You can't set the bar with Jurassic World and then release this. It wasn't good. Apart from seeing the dinasours in excellent CGI the plot was a mess. Greedy villain auctions that go wrong is just lame. Had so much potential. Probably the worst out of them all. Third one has to redeem itself. Big time.,4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,CGI is awesome but scenario and many things are very ordinary and boring. Classic adventure movie.,4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Only decent thing was that CGI looked better than usual. No character development, no real need to care for characters at all. It feels like they tried to make a bunch of cheap modern rip-offs from the two first jurassic movies, speeding them up for a more modern attention span, taking away all the tension from the scenes..",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"Here's my review of Jurassic world : the fallen kingdom. This movie is the sequel to 2015s Jurassic world and stars Peter quill... I mean 'Chris Pratt ' and he's the only good character in this movie like I wouldn't care if anyone else was killed by a dinosaur except for him . This movie was more of a claustrophobic horror flick than an escape movie unlike the rest..did it work ? It sort of did but the jump scares were all very predictable and so was the bad guy's scheme.This movie had a lot of cliche moments from most monster movies and shark movies like the person getting killed first and the monster v monster fight sort of thing. On the bright side I really enjoyed the escape from the island in the film's beginning , probably the best thing about it. There was also a little plot surrounding the professors granddaughter and I thought it was really good. But this movie is like home alone but with a raptor instead of robbers. Then why is it called ' Jurassic world ' you ask ? That is answered in the end by Jeff goldblum and yes . It's a setup for a sequel but in a good way. In the end , the fallen kingdom wasn't as great as it's predecessor but manages to make a movie for the franchise and also keeps you entertained doing so. If these guys throw in a single power rangers dino thunder reference somewhere , then you have my money for the sequel.",4
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"This movie almost has the same plot like Jurassic Park 2, but it's just worse. Why would Chris Pratt agree to do this? The first Jurassic World was A-MA-ZING, but this? Nuh uh! Too much drama",4
Ready Player One,"So I have seen Ready player One movie and most of the way through the book.

I really do not know how in the hell this got made into a movie. It is a boring book that sounds like an ""best of"" list of music, movies, and games of the 1980s. That should not be surprising to anyone who has read it.

The movie it self blows past plot like a bullet and relies heavily on 3D cameos to fill the seats. I can not say in good conscious that I did not get pumped when I saw my favorite IPs in the movie, any fan boy would. That is all it has to offer, cameos.

All in all it was and is a poor set of entertainment, literature, and film.",1
Ready Player One,Where is the man who NO 1 of never gear forever ever Where is Kirito. ?????????????????,1
Ready Player One,"If you watched the movie, you need not say more. I loved the book, and many Spielberg's films. It had many of mistakes that he made in the past. I hate that directors have not learn from their mistakes. Could have been a great movie, why abandon everything about Ludus and education. One of the best points in my opinion from the book. And I can't believe the twist and possibly the iconic story line. Very disappointed, please wait till either Redbox or on demand if you are an avid book fan, but if not just skip.",1
Ready Player One,"What an awful misunderstanding of why the book was so good. The film has none of the nostalgia of the book, none of the clever, sweet points that make the book interesting. Instead, the film is like a childish cartoon.",1
Ready Player One,"The Book is excellent (This one book, the other Cline's book is also a failure). The adaptation is horrible. Probably the worse work Spielberg ever did. He just killed the story line. I did not watch the whole movie. Their removal of the references to Parzival's school planet where the first key actually is and the event after the sixers blow up the stack are way out of line with the book.

Read the book!!!",1
Ready Player One,Entire story betrayed in the first minute of the movie. Disgraceful,1
Ready Player One,"I don't believe that Steven Spielberg nor anyone else involved on the making of this movie have ever read the book on his life. Seems like they've read some (very short) review online and thought ""nice ideia, let's make a movie about it"". Even for those who've never read the book, it's a very weak movie...",1
Ready Player One,I red the book and had realy big expectations witch were not met at all. Only the characters names match with the book not much else. Could have been great but it simply just sucks.,1
Ready Player One,"It is, despite Spielberg's claims, neither a purehearted popcorn flick nor a Paul Verhoevenesque subversion, but something uneasily in between, cowed by the idea of the fanboy demographic.",1
Ready Player One,"If you've read the book, this movie is an absolute torture. And if you didn't, it's still really bad.",1
Ready Player One,I have jusr finished watching ready player one. I can only ask what happend? The story of the book is well written and i cant see how and where the story gos in the movie. I knew going in to the movie that it is hard to convert the book to a film but they miss out and move about too much. Where was the movie tieins? Where was the brain teaser puzzles? Where was arnarac that is what wade refers to all the time? There is so much missing or moved about that they have missed a lot. A jony 5 blowing up at then would have been better than whispering words to stop the orb. I emplor any one that has watched the film read the book as it is so much better. If not that audible it as will weaten dos a very good job reading the book,1
Ready Player One,This was one of the worst movies seen in 2018. This movie is a shame! A waste of time! Super boring!,1
Ready Player One,"This movie is visually brilliant and is a fun, nerdy romp through the virtual reality world of the OASIS. It is a bit overstuffed and the script is not very good, however.",1
Ready Player One,"Base: 5 +1 point for the epic visuals +1 point for the references, which make the book proud -1 point for feeling a bit overstuffed",1
Ready Player One,"I couldnt believe what I saw and stopped the movie half way through. I loved the book and was really excited for the movie, but Spielberg destroyed everything original and smart about the book and dumbed it down for a 21st century American audience. The story of a bestselling book was rewritten in a way that transformers 3 had a better storyline. The characters were soulless and had no background to them. The challenges had no challenge in them. In the first challenges, which is a car race, the a answer is driving backwards. A 6 year old would have tried that in no time. The story goes on like that for the rest of the movie. The all too realistic dystopian was a unrealistic joke. The movie is exactly what the book is warning about. It's the mentality of just wanting to be entertained with easy, dumb trash instead of getting you to think where society and the world might be heading to of people stop caring. Please start using your brains again, read a good book like the real ready player one and don't watch this atrocity. They added a villain and gave him a mayor role, who is mentioned once in the book and has the classic easy Hollywood dumb jokes role. He is ja ja bings all over again. I am done with Spielberg from now on and should have been from the Indiana Jones crystal skull movie. Just sad how his career ends. Bad movie for a dumb audience with bad characters and worse storyline. What a disappointment.",1
Ready Player One,"Everyone's breathing like they ran a sprint. I was glad that the movie was over. It was very shallow both in story and character dev. The main characters fell in love without even knowing each other.

This was a trash movie trying to make a quick buck advertising popular characters.

Target audience 12-16 years old.",1
Ready Player One,"Tons of weird 80's references which is awful for someone who doesn't care for 80's pop culture. Thor Ragnarok was the same but no where near to this level. I know people love this movie, but I'll pass on seeing it again.",1
Ready Player One,"The only scene in the movie that is even close to the book is the end skirmage. The movie is terrible.They turned Artemis into a helpless ""save me"" girl, had the main characters work as a team, which readers of the book know is totally against the main characters' philosophy, removed or changed all the best challenges, retro gaming and retro music that was in the book. If Spielberg disliked the book so much that he had to change every bit of it to make the movie, why did he bother to make the movie? He should have chosen a different book to destroy on film.",1
Ready Player One,"So let me get this straight, I'm supposed to believe that society has fallen apart and people are all obsessed with gaming. We aren't even given a clear explanation about what went wrong with the world, which should clearly be an important factor to help drive the story. People can apparently play games everyday without a care in the world, and I feel like I would have to be completely ignorant to just accept that and enjoy the movie without questioning this fatal flaw. If you want to watch a story about a world harnessing the power of VR then watch Sword Art Online. At least the anime can identify more realistic issues concerning the overuse of such technology and its effect on the real world.

A sci-fi is supposed to at least attempt to answer such questions, and to paint a world which is believable enough for the story to be built around and so in retrospect it falls very flat. Even the characters are very flat, with no attempt to build any depth into their character or backstory, which leaves you feeling no connection or care of any of them.

Not only does Ready Player One fail to tackle any of these problems, but in itself as a movie it's mediocre at best. As a comedy it's predictable, as a romance it's cringe worthy, and in fact all it has going for it is it's lame overuse of CGI and over the top action scenes. We are living in an age where we have the most incredible resource of technology available to us to make high countless high budget movies, and in that sense we're really lucky. But all we get are is an endless collection of superhero movies and rubbish like this.

I'm disappointed with cinema for creating such garbage, and Steven Spielberg should be ashamed of himself for creating such a thing. People need to stop promoting and advocating such rubbish because it's killing cinema.",1
Ready Player One,"How could Spielberg turn the great book in such a horrible movie. The movie was cheap action for 10 year olds, all the references to the 80s gone, the whole spirit of the book lost, the cast a bad joke. If I was American I would sue the company for false pretense when they write ""based on the novel"". You could say ""inspired"" at the utmost. I wish I could unsee it.",1
Ready Player One,I watched the movie for about 20 minutes then I had to cut it off. It was just too boring to watch. It's mostly animated (Cartoon) Suitable for children.,1
Ready Player One,"This is a awful. Cheesey ""old skool"" comments and music combined with sterotypical and daft cartoon chracters make this film awful, It reminds me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but that was funny. Cartoons are for kinds or very light hearted fun for adults. 1/10. Sauage party was FAB, But defo not for kids",1
Ready Player One,What a hack job. It's like they forgot everything that made this story important and fun. Highly dissapointed in the movie :(,1
Ready Player One,"The characters were shallow, unlikeable and frequently acted against their natures - as developed in immediately prior scenes. Incredibly poor pace and plotting. Acting not terrible. Visuals quite good.

And though I never expected it, it had no clear message. Rather than capturing the humanity, loneliness, and search for meaning in a not-so-future world (like the book did), the movie captured... nothing.

I learnt nothing, cared about the characters very little, and would recommend it not at all.",1
Ready Player One,"I attempted to watch this film after reading the book in a day, the book which was truly amazing and stands at one of the best books I have read was followed by a film that does not use anything from the book but the vague plot and the character names, the tasks are not even the same, nor what the characters are even supposed to look like.... the book in my opinion is a million times better and I don't understand how a screen writer has come up with this, if they had read the book then clearly they would have made the film a million times better (that's just to get it to watchable) but if you don't read and have no interest in it I'm sure the film is pretty good when you know no context, but when the book gives so much detail that you see everything in your head and it comes out basically the complete opposite on the film I really don't understand... I got an hour into this film and had to turn it off because I found myself angered by the whole plot... it is not the same as the book at all, it is hardly even based against the book, unless you count the name, the names of the characters and the fact there's a completion, nothing, at all is the same. So disappointed...",1
Ready Player One,"I've read a ton of books that were turned into movies. Therefore, my expectations are very low. There are only two movies (IMO) that we're better than the source material: Misery and Silence of the Lambs. This movie is so far removed from it's source material...I don't even know where to start. The title is the same as the book...the characters have the same names....there's stuff about video games.

The End. This movie is to the book what LeCroix is to fruit.

PS: don't know if this is a spoiler or not, but it's total BS that the girl is the only one who is worried what the boy will think of her actual looks, when the boy in question is a ham-faced dork and Artemis is a bad ass. Go screw yourselves, Hollywood.",2
Ready Player One,"Well, here's the first ever Steven Spielberg movie i didnt like. Actually its also the first one I pretty much hated. Besides some interesting futuristic concepts and visuals, this movie makes no real effort to be believable whatsoever. It also feels like the writers didnt have a good understanding of videogames or virtual reality. I honestly would've thought this movie was written by a 14 year old. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief the the absolute max, wait till this goes on netflix. Otherwise save your money, it's just not worth it.",2
Ready Player One,"Ready Player One doesn't do anything new or unexpected, and takes any unique story behind the concept, throws it to the back and replaces it with pop culture references. But it is a fun and campy adventure, that people of all ages and demographics can enjoy.",2
Ready Player One,"What is Ready Player One about? It is about a young man who lives in a world of virtual reality called the Oasis. In one epic game left by the creator, he must figure out the clues to unlocking the secrets that unlock the game.

If you are a gamer, you will probably like this film. It is like watching one big action video game. I could not wait for this film to end. I think Spielberg forgot that today's generation cares less about culture and history than ever before. This is only my opinion.

The reason for 2 stars is a moral example I would like to share: Let's say that I stay at home and meet all my friends and my girlfriend in online forums. We have lots of fun and adventure. You, the viewer, know this. Then I decide to lecture you about how you should not be in online forums because you should go outside more, take risks, talk to females(or males) in person, and live your life. Would this example keep you off the computer more often?

I think most of the gamers who watch this film are going to go home after the movie and play some more video games.",2
Ready Player One,"...DON'T see the film you will be very disappointed.

If you have never read the book then see the film first then read it because the book will show you how much the film diverted from the storyline.

Was looking forward to this but luckily I can still listen to the book.

Saying that if I had never read the book then the film may have been enjoyable.",2
Ready Player One,"Never read the book, this makes it seem like a silly story.

It's strung together enough that I give it 2 stars, but it's horrible. Abusive use of good music, corny long takes on beloved figures (iron giant, etc). Every second, something like this is thrown in to get attention. It's all to propel a lifeless story forwards.

Lots of acting, as in, it feels fake in every way. I wanted to vomit when percival-whatever faked crying at the end. This movie is empty of curiosity, nothing you see or hear has immediate value, it's 100% recycled.",2
Ready Player One,"This movie was awful. Worst adaptation of a book to a movie I've ever seen. Forget that it basically has nothing to do with the book other than the names of the characters and the title of the movie, it was just a bad movie. Terrible dialogue, acting is worse, and there is basically no flow to the movie at all. Don't waste your money or time on this junk.",2
Ready Player One,"The book was so much better, and I don't know why the movie deviated so much. I agree with other opinions that its not worthy of the title.

I started to list all the differences between the move and the book, but it deviates so much that its really a different story. Any one who is interested, should read and discover the book, its fantastic.",2
Ready Player One,This movie is really bad... The original book was turned into a campy soulless flic that paid tribute to the the 80's mostly by capturing how cheesy it could be. It did not capture the essence of what the book was about nor did it personify the protagonists accurately. Really really disappointed that such a cool story was turned into such a hot mess.,2
Ready Player One,"If I didn't know who the director was here, I would have guessed it was someone who was really influenced by Spielberg, but trying really hard to make sense of the current technological world we live in. However, knowing it IS Spielberg, it seems that he's trying depserately to reclaim his 80s glory here by shoving every possible pop culture reference in to this completely silly film. It seems that he's lost his touch and is out of touch with the world as it is today.

One wonders who the audience was intended to be with this film? 98% of the pop culture references are from the 70s/80s/90s, so I can't imagine anyone under 20 enjoying this film or even knowing what is being discussed half the time. I know that my 16 year old son could care less about 80s pop culture (outside of a few films he's seen, he surely didn't know what the hell went on in this film!). So, was Spielberg aiming at his own generation? Himself?

Then there is the plot.. if you cal lit that. It's another simplistic ""find some treasure and save the world along the way"" deal that you would expect from Spielberg. But, watered down a lot. One can really see potential here; say, if Cronenberg directed, or someone younger. Plenty of commentary and opportunity to try to set people on the right track. Instead, Spielberg glosses over the commentary stuff and never really digs too deep. A lot of ""Black Mirror""-like moments are played for light laughs rather than the grim horror they really are.

Yet, even as a ""light"" entertainment piece, it's scattered everywhere. Again, the audience won't ""get"" many of the references and only then be looking for real drama or action to grip onto. Instead, we get faux video game action that is about as exciting as watching Spielberg dressed up as a teen trying to fit in by playing XBOX: you are passive and wish to be interactive, or at least passively watching something you can care about.",2
Ready Player One,"BESIDE THE EASTER EGGS IN THE MOVIE, WHERE IS THE LOGIC, WHERE IS THE NICE STORY TELLING. IT BASICALLY HAS ZERO TWIST BECAUSE IT'S REALLY EASY TO GUESS. I CAN'T LOVE THIS MOVIE JUST BECAUSE IT HAS SOME PIECES OF MY CHILDHOOD. THIS MOVIE IS PLAIN BAD",2
Ready Player One,"I had make an account just for this review, it was THAT disappointing...

When i heard about this movie and what it is about, i got super hyped, as a avid gamer and someone who loves pop culture references. I haven't read the book or even knew this was based on a book (which apparently is pretty awesome from what i hear) so my dissapointement has nothing to do with that aspect.

It felt like just another badly made generic Hollywood adventure/love story with shallow characters, a stupid message trying to sound smart and deep, inside a shell of pop culture references to pull in the audiences since gaming has become so mainstream. It is the movie everyone has seen a million times with a different skin.

I honestly only enjoyed like two scenes in the whole movie and chuckled lightly maybe thrice (laughed out loud once, at the end when the directors name was shown), with nothing really memorable and tons of stupid loopholes and characters acting in a non believable way and sadly no character development whatsoever.

The only reason i would recommend watching this is if you where to be high enough to only care about the bright visuals (graphics were mediocre, but bright and colorful), pop culture references and you do not wish to have to think at all. But for that purpose there are so many other better movies, this is just a new option if you have ""seen it all""

I am actually really sad to leave a review like this, i wanted to really enjoy this movie, it combines so many things i love and has so much potential, instead it chooses to dangle them in front of me and obliterate them.

Funnily enough i didn't know Spielberg even directed this till the end, and at that point i was not surprised at all, seeing his name as the director was actually one of the movies best moments because it was the only moment that made me laugh out loud, i am starting to feel like he is a master troll, if he made this as a intentional troll, then 10/10 kudos to you Spielberg. Kappa.",2
Ready Player One,"*MINOR SPOILERS*

I am a simple man. I expect my video game movies to follow a coherent representation of my games. So when I saw a holy hand grenade being purchased I could not wait for it to be used. And it was. And that was the biggest disappointment of 2018. How in the holy hell do they use a Holy Hand Grenade and it does NOT make the HALELUJA sound before exploding? HOW? Would have given 1/10 but the movie is pretty cool otherwise.",2
Ready Player One,"Saw this yesterday and thought - WTF happened here?!? Came to IMDB to find out that as of today it had a 7.7* rating which is just ridiculous. I had to reset my password to this site, because I don't do reviews usually. But this made me go through the trouble.

I read the book. I thought it was mediocre, but you know Young Adults and all that. Listened to the audio book a year later when I found out about the movie coming out, and it kind of grew on me. Still very much a mediocre book, but I'm a huge fan of the 80s, games, geekdom and all that so I had an appreciation for it.

Then yesterday I saw the movie. The movie made the book look like the best literary master piece of the last 1000 years. This movie depicted EVERYTHING that's WRONG with Hollywood. The story was butchered so badly that at best it had like 20% of the book. Character arcs were changed, story line was nothing like the original, the essence of characters was completely butchered and changed, new characters were introduced that added absolutely zero to the movie. The romantic story was so Hollywood-ized it was barf worthy.

Here's the summation:

People who had read the book thought - ""WTF happaned?"" People who had not read the book thought ""WTF is happening"" throughout the whole movie.",2
Ready Player One,"Being a huge fan of the book, you may be disappointed.Other than the overall concept, the movie does everything it can to not follow the book, it may as well be called an entirely different title. It completely rips the book apart and partially sewing it back together here and there. So, if you are like me and was very excited to see how great the book could be as a movie- expect to get your hopes destroyed. I could not enjoy it as i felt let down and it really did not need changing and the movie lost it's way.

My husband who has not read the book, enjoyed the film. He loved the gaming references and the graphics. I agree these were good.

For me, i felt it lacked substance and yes there were some great gaming references but it did not live and breath the 80's like it should have and the plot i think was a little tame, childish and rushed.

I wanted to like this so much so i would say do no read the book if you want to enjoy the movie.",2
Ready Player One,"Do not read the book if you want to enjoy the movie. If you didn't, maybe this is a 5 or 6. The storyline was very disjointed. I understand needing to make more action but that could have been done without changing 90% of the story. Why don't these egomaniacs learn?",2
Ready Player One,"I get that the film versions are never as good as the book, so I didn't go in expecting it to be. However, almost EVERYTHING was changed for the film except the general premise and character names. Everything good about the book was missing here. There is no character development whatsoever, everything is completely predictable, and there is no depth to the plot at all. Spielberg is washed up! What a joke this film is. Ernest Cline has to be furious.",2
Ready Player One,"Yes, I read the book before seeing the movie. Yes, most film adaptations of books are not great representations of the original material. However, I'll counter that thin argument by saying that in the hands of a great director like Spielberg, a book adaptation should be so much more faithful to the plot which makes it great, rather than just good. Take Peter Jackson's Lord of the rings trilogy. He knew there was too much material to squeeze into a 3 hour movie, so he made 3 movies, and ended up with arguably the greatest fantasy adventure movies ever created. Spielberg ends up here with a movie that is entertaining for the masses who didn't read the book, but with something that could and should have been so much greater, deeper, and intelligently done.

The quest for the keys in the book is great entertainment and would translate nicely onto the screen. Instead we get a car race which is so fast and full of reference that it's hard to keep up, a second key hidden inside a movie which was nothing to do with the book, and overall character reveals which don't trigger any emotional response (as they did in the book).

It's difficult to give this movie a fair review, as I can see it from both sides of the coin (my wife who didn't read the book, and my 8 year old son loved it), but I'm aware of what it could have been, and I'm only disappointed.

Please, if you've not read the book, get down to a library and immerse yourself in it. I read it in a day and it was absolutely incredible. I grew up on pretty much all the nostalgic references, and the characters and plot are superbly done. I guarantee you'll love the book way more than you enjoyed the film.",2
Ready Player One,"Nothing, like NOTHING like the book - so disepointed with this film.",2
Ready Player One,"I watched this list night. I'm so disappointed. Listen to us book fans, the original story would've transferred brilliantly to a film, and we'd all be marvelling at it's brilliance. Instead we're left with nothing more than children's cartoon levels of story telling. Just because it's Spielberg, it doesn't mean it's good...",2
Ready Player One,"I found myself hating this film as much for the references (which were supposed to be a selling point but weren't even really references, just nostalgic wallpaper to cover over the fact that the stakes in this film were almost irrelevant as I didn't really care what happened to the central characters because they were bland, generic garbage) as I did the pacing, made for millennials, a never ending, never breathing, break neck pace full of sound and fury et al .

I was also pretty mad at all of the stuff from my childhood 'used' like blunt instruments to try and illicit the feeling of a more quality product. The film makers thought to themselves that Ready Player One is a smoothie made out of lobster, wagyu beef, brie cheese and champagne, the finest foods there are, so it MUST taste good. No, it's crap and the simplicity of their thinking that having implicated good properties into this gunge somehow elevates it is embarrassing.

Great if you like playing 'spot that stolen property', not very entertaining and I just found myself infuriated and wanted it to end.",2
Ready Player One,"There are a couple cool CGI moments here. Other than that, the variations from the quality storyline in the movie are painful. If you loved the book, skip the movie. You can't unwatch this low quality adaptation. I understand the entire book wasn't visual but still, for shame screenwriter and Spielberg!",2
Ready Player One,"Here's a review from someone that didn't read the book and had no idea what to expect going in to the movie: Nope. Although the nostalgia & useless trivia from the past decades had some of my attention, overall I winced every minute this movie went on. So. Boring. So. Predictable. So. Awful. The CGI was painstakingly bad. The acting worse. I didn't understand how anyone who came up with the screenplay thought having this group of VI friends that met in a world of billions of people all over earth happened to be in the exact 25 mile radius ( bad people too! What are the odds!) Main female gives this speech about how you don't know what they look like in reality, you're expecting something completely different and she's gorgeous but has a birth mark on her face? OH NO! Tragic. The best character was the 11 year old, and he barely got any screen time. Also: 5 years after his death and still no one figured out that first race? Mmmkay. Those aren't even the worst of the plot holes. Maybe if I read the book I'll feel even more depressed about the time wasted watching this.",2
Ready Player One,"I watched this film last night. It was easily the worst film I have seen in a while. I found it trite, puerile lacking in pathos and heart.

Honestly do not waste you time on this unfettered rubbish.",2
Ready Player One,"The book was decent, but this movie is unwatchable. Actors are bad, music is not used well, and the plot is just horrible. They made an interesting story a one sided action movie. This adaptation removed important plot points and just kept the concept from the book.

Do not bother watching this movie, especially if you've read the book",2
Ready Player One,"Its just a silly kids film. Don't bother watching.

Offically taken steven spielburg off of my list of favourite directors",3
Ready Player One,"Well.... it starts off decent, got my hopes up and then... and then... yes at this point you start to see to many plot holes, I think the animators vs the filmmakers didnt work together, cause it has so many errors in it that dosent make sense.

What was annoying for me was not the bad acting, cause it had some of that also, but that ""in a virtual reality environment"" where you can run in an open ended world with ppl from everywhere, ALL of a sudden its always the person naxt to you that is the person in the virtual reality? Like wtf, they all stand still?

It was very annoying though out the entire flick.",3
Ready Player One,"As a stand alone film this might have been ok, but as a film adapted from a book this is one of the worst I've seen. The only thing that is carried over is characters names & small parts of the story. This could have been called anything else & been an ok film but it didn't & it's not",3
Ready Player One,"I felt like the movie changed so much from the book, that if you are a fan of the book, you will plainly see how lazy and generalized this adaptation is.

The book is truly phenomenal, if you like (and know) the call backs to 1980s pop culture and gaming. Do yourself a favor and just read the book.

While I understand fighting a pixelated Joust or quoting Monty Python for an hour and a half wouldn't translated well on screen...Steven Spielberg changed so much that it transformed the narrative from in-depth character formation, vital life lessons, and pulled so many significant events that it takes away from the original plot. It felt as though this was just another punch-out film from a once great director. The movie is curated to such a wide audience that it loses everything that made the book so great.

However, I did enjoy I-rok's new and continuing role throughout the film. The only save the movie had for a book fan.",3
Ready Player One,"Is there more then one steven Speilberg. ? Noway that Steven Speilberg that made Jaws, Raidars of the lost ark, has had anyhting todo with this pile of junk!.

I think it must be Steven Speilbergs assitans or tranee who put his name on this.

I just spent 2 hours 20 min watch this crap, sorry didn't know there was a book. How can someoe write somethng like this, this is what tv pumps out a million of each day.

This movie is 85% pure CGI! nothing else I know the Steven Speilberg I love has a vision and he hates CGI!, and this movie is just pile on pile with CGI

CGI = Computer Generated Imagery

I am chocked hope I never will see steven speilbergs name on anyhting like this again.",3
Ready Player One,"What is fun about this movie?... the visuals and all the pop culture references.. you might will have the eager to re-watch just to catch what you missed the first time. The plot is not unique and few scenes were rushed, but the presentation is amazing. I didn't read the book but heard that it is different from this movie and I hope it gave more background story to the main characters as what was given in this movie was a shell for most characters. The main message that can be obtained from this movie is easily understood.

It is definitely worth the time for watching at least one time (maybe re-watching just to catch what you missed the first time you watched!).",3
Ready Player One,"I bought and read the book before this movie came out. Loved it and it described the OASIS world in such a way it just all made sense.

All the sense is missing in the movie. All the logic that made the world believable is gone. All the nerdy research about 90s culture is missing.

So disappointing.",3
Ready Player One,"I'm not one of those reviewers that loved the book. I found the book mildly entertaining but was overall unimpressed. I thought maybe seeing the book come alive on the screen would serve the story better but the story was only sort of present in the film. The basic frame is there but the soul is gone. Really though, Ready Player One is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory only with video games, virtual reality, and not nearly as good. Unlike Charlie and the Choclate Factory there is no wicked humor and no Gene Wilder. There were enough 80s and 90s references to be mildly entertaining but after awhile the whole thing becomes a bit of a mess - too much CGI and too much mindless action. I also had hopes that they would fix the rampant sexism, homophobia, and racism in the book when they made the film only to discover that all the things that made Aech, Art3mis, Shoto, and Daito remotely cool in the book are either gone or greatly watered down - what a shock. So... if you want to see mind numbing testosterone fueled action where sexism, homophobia, and racism have survived the ""corn-syrup shortage"" and the "" bandwidth riots"" then this movie is for you!",3
Ready Player One,"I loved this book. The story had great dialog, great back stories, mystery, likeable characters and misunderstood geniuses. This movie had none of that. It felt rushed, like the movie had to be squeezed into the time allotted and it left out everything that made the story great. This could have easily been a trilogy if the good parts had been left in the storyline. But it was another a mind numbing, special effect ladened superhero movie.

The CGI was good, but the scenes from inside the game looked like cut scenes from your average video game. Unfortunately I couldn't finish watching the movie because of my disappointment.

Spielberg needs to retire.......",3
Ready Player One,"Now bare in mind, most of my life is stuff exactly like this: popculture salads of explosions and nostalgia sold to me as big budget video games and movies. We got this in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Wreck it Ralph, Kingdom Hearts, Lego Movie, Marvel Vs Capcom, South Ppark in Imagination Land and god knows what else. This is FAMILIAR TERRITORY to explore the jungle of our collective imaginations.

AND IT SUCKS IN THIS MOVIE.

It is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but no other kids get eliminated with any moral to it, Slugworth has an army of machine gun toting thugs and no cops in the way to stop him, and Willy Wonka is sitting in the corner chewing on his own clothing quietly like a kid with pica. And throw in a hot girlfriend who is sad because of a contrived backstory and she is not pretty enough in real life.

Oh, you think this film is better than this? Well, if you see any love on the screen it is not in the main plot. The cameos, the in jokes, the references, and all that were given to the post production and special effects teams and were added like bumper stickers to the back of my ugly broken car. It is still an ugly broken car no matter how many stickers I put on it. But unlike my car, you might see my car for 2 minutes in traffic. You are not locked into starring at the back of my car for 2 hours to analyze why Marvin the Martian, Robocop, and Chun Li are standing next to eachother. There is no juxtaposition to give these cameos relevance.

It is not an army of heroes vs an army of villains. It is not an army of souless robots vs fanciful whimsical creatures. It is not werewolves against vampires. There is no difference between the machine gun touting army of soldiers, robots, and wizards and the good guy machine gun touting army of soldiers, robots, and wizards. FAIL. ARTISTIC FAIL.

And one last tangent: in a game world where people can apparently use the Oasis with a keyboard at their desk.............why have full body virtual reality slave phone booths? Shouldn't they just be in cubicles? Are cubicles more expensive than the full body VR doom chambers?",3
Ready Player One,"Unbelievable rape of the awesome story in the book! Spielberg, I'm ashamed of you for releasing this crap of a movie when it could have been a huge blockbuster! Cline, I'm disappointed you would let him get away with taking all the feeling and fun out of your story!",3
Ready Player One,"I rented this thinking, ""how bad can it be?"" Well it's a whole lot worse than I ever imagined. I give it 3 stars for some of the set pieces and impressive 3D.",3
Ready Player One,Honestly this could have been great but unless you're 12 and under it's not worth watching. It's way too long and even with the 80s theme and the music it still doesn't make for good viewing. The high scores on here must come from those that are easily pleased and prefer content over depth of a story and character building. I gave it 3 for the CGI which is amazing but I would have preferred a film with about 90% less of it as the real world they lived in had alot more interest to it. Bore-a-thon yawn,3
Ready Player One,"With a terrible source material, Spielberg decided to create his Avatar movie. The story is as bad. There are as many clichés. This movie won't ever surprise you (that might be a staple of the director?).

Spielberg knows what to do to create a couple of heroes and villains, and he does just that. The movie is, in reality, an avalanche of references of pop culture with the shape of an action flick and some sparkles of Spielberg sentimentalism (gag inducing, but with professionally placed scenes by Spielberg).

The only reason to especially like this movie is the references. I don't care about them (and probably I didn't catch half of them), so.",3
Ready Player One,"Basically it's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The eccentric owner of a company sets death trap puzzles and the young protagonist has to solve them to gain control of the company. Remember in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that a rich guy had his employees unwrap chocolate bars to find a golden ticket? Yeah, this one has a rival company use employees to play the video game, except the employees are debtors like in The Diamond Age --assuming that throwaway idea was still in the book after it was retitled; originally read it as an ARC when it was called A Young Lady's Primer or something like that. And that's the exact kind of geekdropping that this movie is chock-full of. So if you liked all the 80s nostalgia stuff in Atomic Blonde and you either don't make a lot of CGI or plan to watch it while doing housework (which is what I did, I watched it via you know who that starts with an n and ends with a flix) then you'll probably like it.",3
Ready Player One,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I wanted to finish the book first and so I raced through, captivated by the story. I couldn't put it down and was desperate to get to the end so I could watch the big-screen version. What a terrible let down.

The film is nothing like the book at all. I expected some of the scenes and sub-plots to be removed to get it down to roughly two hours, but the plot is virtually unrecognizable. The characters don't match those described in the book, which takes away some of the key developments in the story. The pace is too fast because they are just trying to cram things in and there's not much context given to anything. I don't understand how anyone who hasn't read the book could follow It! Despite being really excited to watch it, I found myself playing with my phone halfway through because I was bored.

I really wanted to love this film but unfortunately I think this is the most disappointed I have ever been with a book-to-film transition :-(",3
Ready Player One,"A poorly envisioned world made up of nostalgia and references. If you aren't blinded by these you'll see how shallow and ridiculous much of this movie is. It constantly misses the point, and everyone is stupid. Also the whole club fight scene. No thanks.

Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 3/10 Movie Score (LetterBoxd): 4/10",3
Ready Player One,"Watching the movie, I left feeling quite empty. The plot seemed quite shallow, the characters were very one dimensional. I could tell when watching it that there was so much untapped potential in the story. Like the world they lived in - the movie provided so little detail behind why it was the way it was and what it was really like to live there. And the challenges the characters had to go through always seemed way too easy. When the movie finished, I was disappointed because I knew it could have been so much better and couldn't understand why Spielberg had made such a botched job of it.

That confusion has since become much greater having read the book, which by the way is AMAZING! Like many other reviewers have said here, it's practically a completely different story to the movie. Apart from a similar overarching plot line, everything else that happens in it is different. All the challenges are different, the way the characters interact with one another, the pop culture references... so different and just so, so much better than the movie.

So for anyone feeling let down by the movie, I highly recommend checking out the book. It's an easy read and one where the story will pull you in and you'll have a hard time putting down the book until you've finished it.

3/10 for the movie 10/10 for the book",3
Ready Player One,"Keep the book plot, characters and background in your mind and heart and leave the story there. The film doesn't follow the book in anyway at all other than the characters have the same names. The book is in my top 4 books and I loved every page. This film was so difficult to watch so much so I am writing this review with only 10 minutes of the movie. Its an ok-ish action fantasy film in its own rights. Just don't watch it because you loved the book!",3
Ready Player One,"Let me start by saying that the film, for the first 45 minutes was pretty good. A very nicely rendered ripoff of Summer Wars. Sadly the entire film is the story of a man that created a virtual world based on other peoples work. Acquiring the rights to all that stuff must have been tough for James Halladay. The finale was ridiculous to say the least. I mean seriously, what happened to all the poor that got zeroed out???",3
Ready Player One,Gets surprisingly dull after the initial overload of special effects. The plot is so cliched and predictable that nothing can make up for it.,3
Ready Player One,"I really wanted to like it. It started out very promising, with an exciting, creative premise and eye-catching, attractive, detailed visuals. The concept of the type of society they live in, and the story that was unfolding intrigued me a lot.

Then lame elements started adding up. 45 minutes in, I was forgiving of them, because I was still intrigued. But they kept piling up, until I was cringing more and more.

By ""lameness"", I mean it feels like a kid wrote it. I like kids' movies, but this actually feels like a kid wrote the screenplay...

Cliches... Missed opportunities for including any truly clever ideas... A naive and primitive understanding of the world that I wasn't buying, even for a sci-fi fantasy movie... Plot devices that seem ad-hoc, instead of crafted into a broader context, like the screenwriter was making up the whole story up as they were typing it out...

Half way through the movie, I was getting restless, and hoping for it to end soon. I only continued watching it because I was invested at this point. I was curious to find out what would happen, but I wasn't enjoying myself anymore.

1.5 / 5 - pretty bad",3
Ready Player One,"It has all the faults of a typical hollywood action movie: based on a tried and tired formula, no character depth, no character arcs, lots of ""explosions n stuff"", very bad camera work, lots of pop culture references, and oddly too low on imagination.

It is baffling how a story that is set in 2045 has all its pop references in the 80s: all the music you hear, the movies and actors and directors they hint on, even the games they refer to are atari games! It is obvious this movie is based on the imagination of an 80s boy, with 80s nostalgia.

That could be forgiven if the story telling was actually good. The movie starts with a LONG exposition narration, that TELLS you who everyone is, who the baddie is and who the good guys are, how the world functions, and all the boring stuff. After that (since the viewers are obviously bored) we switch to a long mindless action scene which is supposed to look cool but actually games in 2010 had better graphics than that. Basically the virtual world of the movie passes as if u r watching a very long cutscene in a videogame and you are not even playing. You are just being bored out of your mind.

The cardboard characters are so one-dimensional that the writer didn't even bother with giving them an arc. They just go around, do stuff, find the macguffins, defeat the boss, and that's it, game over.

After the movie finishes in the most anticlimatic way, you might only have one question, and that is how a person who made ""schindler's list"" makes sth as horrendous as this pickle 15 years later.",3
Ready Player One,"While visually very impressive the writing is full of jokes that don't land and an over reliance on cheap pop-culture references. I don't hate this film as much as some people, but I don't think it's particularly great either",3
Ready Player One,"I had generally high expectations before seeing this movie, but when I saw this in theaters, I did not like this at all. The storytelling was weak and a bit too slow-paced. It seemed kind of boring. The theme is good, but overall, this movie is not one of Spielberg's best. I recommend you watch E.T instead.",3
Ready Player One,"Took a gamble on this one. Even made four buddies come with me... Some cool special effects, but unless You're 12 years old - SKIP. Movie is so long, and childish it just becomes flat out annoying. Now I'm banned from picking movies for at least a month.",4
Ready Player One,"Mister Spielberg please stop doing SciFi movies. This one is not worst than the war of the worlds, but is not far! Just compare your fantastic work for Duel and this last. There is no comparison possible, in the first the spectator could feel many different emotions, without much dialog, no explanation, special effects or special flash back. In this last no emotion, a lot of explanation, special effects The casting in my opinion does not work, the music shows that you are not connected with that world. In this movie the animation is fake, but worst in the real world, a part of a few exception there is no play, no emotions, no tension, love appears by miracle in a few sec. Sorry",4
Ready Player One,"Considering it's expected for an adaptation to include a series of changes to better incorporate itself to the new medium, we can say that the movie is pretty faithful to the source material - In the sense that it took a book that had good ideas, but amauterish execution filled with tiresome exposition, and made it into a movie that ALSO has good ideas, but amauterish execution filled with exposition. But they forgot that the book had at least some emotional investment.

If you want that much to see an action movie with young protagonists, nerd references and pretty visual effects, watch Scott Pilgrim. It has the same theme of video games immersed in the daily life, with 10 times more personality. But if you're actually interested to see a bastardized adaptation with pooly written characters, I suggest Death Note (2017). Both are available on Netflix and will save you the ticket money.",4
Ready Player One,"It would have been better not to have read the book because I was SO EXCITED to see this amazing book in movie form. But aside from the genera plot line - OASIS inventor dies, search for 3 keys, Theo wins - absolutely nothing is like the book. I was disappointed, but my friends who hadn't read the book loved it. There are a handful of 80s references but they're not the same nor nearly integral as they are in the book. The book has some brilliant insights and ideas about how VR can benefit the world (ie using it for schools to enhance teaching and provide better education to kids everywhere without regard to income or other factors, and eliminate bullying and other obstacles in school) balanced with how VR can be exploited and hurt society, but this movie shows only high octane use of VR and negative influence. I can't believe Ernest Cline wrote and approved this screenplay. SHAME!",4
Ready Player One,"The movie was ""inspired by"" not ""based upon"" the novel of the same name. Much of the nostalgic references were removed. Anymore these days books are written with its own storyline, then are made into movies with an alternate storyline all in hopes of cashing in. Most of the acting was just OK, but there were some lines of dialogue that were delivered as if they were just rehearsing.",4
Ready Player One,"Review title says it all. Plus, basically reprisals of the chief antagonists' roles, if you ask me, Ben Mendelsohn and Hannah John-Kamen, between their roles in Bloodline and Killjoys, respectively.",4
Ready Player One,"I had higher expectations, Great story and an amazing world that had bigger potential yet unfortunately fell through and limited itself to cliches and subpar story that aims to please rather than go deep.

The technology is impressive yet there are also some gltiches in the future where cars look More obsolete than today.",4
Ready Player One,"Absolutely nothing like the book, Spielberg took all of the 80s culture out, didn't move you like in the book and took away the amagination of the characters, read the book, don't watch the movie.",4
Ready Player One,"First off, it is a nice movie. But the deviation from the book is so massive that it's no longer Ready Player One but a different story set in the same universe where the main characters have the same names by pure coincidence.

While some changes were certainly necessary for a movie adaptation, the scope and type of changes in the movie are just insanely bad. Changing the main characters and story to such an extent is not only unnecessary but laughably stupid.

In a frame set by the book the challenge design makes no sense and the story progression outside the OASIS is completely counter to anything that fits the world built by Ernest Cline.

Overall, it can be very much recommended for people who have no interest in the book but as someone who has enjoyed the original this was just yet another in a long series of severely disappointing adaptations.",4
Ready Player One,The movie is basically a sequence of references of pop culture thrown down your throat. Wreck it! Ralph did a much better job!,4
Ready Player One,"Felt like too much time was spent in the 'virtual world', most of the jokes weren't funny and the main protagonist's avatar had a face that most people would want to punch",4
Ready Player One,"Very little to recommend here, especially for those who don't care to watch a DeLorean outrace King Kong.",4
Ready Player One,I often had to remind myself that I wasn't watching a Spy Kids film.,4
Ready Player One,"This film is garbage. I remember seeing the trailer and thought it looked quite cringey. A work colleague mentioned he'd read the book and it was quite good. So I gave the book a go and really enjoyed it. While it was a little cringey in places it was a good book. So I then quite looked forward to film. This film takes the overarching theme and throws all that's good out of the window. I was so disappointed to find so many great moments from the book totally abandoned. Such a wasted opportunity. What we end up with is a super generic, weak attempt. The film felt rushed and totally lacking of substance. Every now and then they throw something in that happens in the book totally out of context just so it has something from the book. The end was terrible. It throws in concepts that totally ruin the world and physics of real world/vr interaction. Seems like it's made by someone who has never played a computer game. How did Ernest Cline agree to this!?",4
Ready Player One,"This one had me torn at first glance but I came to realise it was not it didn't have a whole lot to offer. It was mostly pretty cringe but at the same type this is my field so I was kinda hype also. The Oasis itself was super cool and was just about the only thing going for this movie. Nothing outside of the Oasis was remotely interesting and had little to no impact of any kind. I lie there was some impact of cringe, especially at the 'relationship' between main guy and main girl (don't remember their names who cares).

The idea of the big game to get ownership was cool in thought but the creator guy didn't seem like the type to have the secret clues be so related to him personally, he ain't Voldemort. The game was decent fun otherwise, with the standout being the race.

Overall pretty skippable. There's a lot of 'ooh I know (insert pop culture thing here)' moments but that's about all it has

See 'Summer Wars (2009)' for a movie that does this type of premise but is actually worth your time.",4
Ready Player One,"Stopped watching in 20 minutes, boring at all! Repeated the similar genre movies...",4
Ready Player One,"It's just Not ok when you bring vast numbers of super hero from the last 20 years into your own 2 hrs and 20 min movies. Same happens with Marvel's last movie - 10 superheroes ..into another MEGA blockbuster, which was also that bad.

Ps: I would love to see Ironman in the prequel / sequel.",4
Ready Player One,"The novel kind of tired me out; even though I am of an age where I get *every* pop-culture reference, and played *every* video game, I got bored with the never-ending gushiness of it all. But I read it, and generally enjoyed it.

But the movie uses pretty much all of the dazzle of the book, and leaves behind pretty much all of the ""meat"" of it. Yes, the oasis is cool; it's a crossover between ""second life"" and your average PS4 game -- but for all its supposed sophistication, the oasis looks like a game of ""World of Warcraft"". An old one.

But what happened to the characters? Parzival is your average Spielberg hero -- pretty, but empty. He's pretty empty. But he must, no matter what, stop whatever he's doing to... save the girl. (In the book, it is Z who is captured.) And the heroine can thereafter wander around the evil guys lair without let or hinderance because even though they know *exactly* who she is, and exactly what she looks like, she can go anywhere -- even the head naughty-man's sanctum, and nobody notices. There were people who were not me what were saying (out loud), ""oh, c'mon!"" at this.

And the others 'gunters'? They are supposed to be the best of the best -- heck, Artemus is supposed to be *the* best. But she knows practically nothing that matters. Another supposedly 'elite' character announces that he can't help with a puzzle (the endlessly dull ""Shining"" one), because he is scared of the movie. What, he couldn't read the script? But anyway, since this is a Spielberg movie, there must be a 'fish out of water' that the hero explains things to -- to pass on information to the audience. In this case, this involves Z telling Artie things she *must* already know, to be the gunter she supposedly is. In the book, the quest is a matter of figuring out puzzles. In this movie, it's basically Z already knowing all there is to know, slogging his way through it, and dragging the rest of the ""high 5"" along; apparently because he likes to talk to them.

The movie nevertheless has a real problem with the contests for the keys, which are the driving force of the quest. For the book, the puzzles were tough, and led you to a tough contest to 'win' the key. (Also, it left out entirely that each character had to win the key personally. In the movie, once the key was used, everybody could just rush in. It cheapened things.) In the movie, the contest was an afterthought; once a character arrived at the contest arena, the key was essentially handed to them.

So, no, didn't like it. It did what Hollywood often does to complex stories, it dumbs them down (""simplifies them for the audience""), it uses stereotypes shamelessly (""uses archetypes""), and whenever things slow down, throws in explosions (""action sequence."") The only really surprising thing is that the original author at least put himself in as a script-by. They took a cute niche story and turned it into ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of 80's Videogames"", and he, apparently, helped. I'm sure the money was... excellent. The movie was... not.",4
Ready Player One,"I don't know what this movie is, but this is not Ready Player One. There's adapting a book to cinema and there's making a movie with the same name, same characters names (basically the only thing thats the same about them. Except for Shoto) and the same keys colors... This movie is a huge disappointment to me as a book reader. I just can't believe that Ernest Cline is actually related to this screenplay.

Just read the book. Its a much better story.

As a stand alone film? It's almost fine. Just action for the sake of action...

Score: meh/10.",4
Ready Player One,"Oh man no! Having read the book twice, which was excellent, i was really looking forward to this. What a disappointment. First off the acting and dialogue were terrible, at times cringe worthy. Absolutely no chemistry between Parzival, Artemis, and Aech. In the book they would sit around in an OASIS room chatting and busting each others chops. That was missing in the movie. No time to get to know the characters. Plus Halliday looked and talked like Garth from Wayne's World. ""Party on Parzival"". The scenes in the OASIS were visually cool but again bad dialogue and at times difficult to follow. Too bad. I highly recommend reading the book, twice.",4
Ready Player One,"There are some spoilers here.

I get it. Many parts of the book, like the beginning when he finds the first key would be really hard to make into a movie. I understand that. But then again, maybe this should never have been made into a movie? Here we end up with a movie that has some of the names in common with the book, but that is it. For those who has not read it, this might be good, but for those of us who expected it to be based on the book it is a disappointment.

For fans of the story: There is almost nothing from the book here. Lower your expectations, and you may not end up as disappointed as me.",4
Ready Player One,The most underwhelming Spielberg movie I have seen.,4
Ready Player One,"This has to be the worst spielberg film I have ever seen. Once I learned the dude directed this, and it was based on a book, I was suspicious as I have never read it, I would usually think I would not go fanboy over it. PLus once I see commercials for a movie or anything else, its almost guaranteed I can tell if it will be good or not. NOt whether I like it or not, whether it will be good or not. Thats just the curse of the immersive mess that is the preview sector for hollywood. BUt this film just plain sucked. The acting was abysmal, being worse than C movies ( less than B movies, yes they exist) and nothing to really give anyone with even the slightest interest in the future, investigation into predictions made from all corners of the ""futurist"" world, and nothing in the film wowed at all. This was just a waste of time, and younger folks, helk anyone that knows nothing about the subjects foretold long ago, would do better to simply read classic science fiction from the greats, and numerous anime from 20 years ago that already covered these subjects in player one much much better and thoroughly. *Smfh * Terrible film. Only worth a 3/10 since it was by spielburg. Shame.",4
Ready Player One,Lots of cussing for a kid/ young adult movie. The movie would have been amazing otherwise.,4
Ready Player One,"If I had never read the book I probably would have really liked this movie, but as someone who thought the book was pretty good (not incredible) this is a let-down. It skips past nearly all of the world- and character-building that the book takes great pains to articulate and instead crams a whole bunch of licensed characters, worlds and names in front of you. A solid 9/10 on the audio-visual front because it looks and sounds fantastic, but it just throws the characters into relationships with one another and does virtually zero storytelling.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"This movie is set after Avengers endgame and in this movie Peter Parker went on holiday in Europe with his class. During the holiday Peter fight aliens and than he fights Mysterio who at first wanted to and pretend that he is someone else help them but than he turns that he is evil. This movie is bad mostly becaouse it copies Spider man homecoming and also who Peter now has crush on MJ becaouse he did't pay attencion on her in previous Spiderman movie,they probably wanted to give Zendaya bigger role becaouse she became so popular ,also every MCU movie who come after this movie is not very goo.d.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"So after Peter decided he doesn't want to be Spiderman at the end of Homecoming we begin with him being one of the only Marvel Universe characters able to help Fury.

Pretty much makes the ending of Homecoming obselete.

The whiney Spiderman literally is pissed off he can't enjoy his vacation and every action scene is him yet again sounding like he hasn't got a clue and that he has sucked on a helium balloon.

Also mysterio has some weird followers who basically sound like brain dead idiots who just cheer when they dont even know what they are cheering for

Can pretty much see why they got Garfield and Maguire in for the last installment. How this film grossed a billion ill never know.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Such a boring movie. So much CGI and bland story, and cliffhanger OMG. Ridiculous! I love Spiderman movies, and Toby's SM was the best. Followed by that unlikeable Peter Parker in Amazing Spiderman. Homecoming was very good Spiderman reboot. But this boring garbage with ridiculous fights, fire beast and holograms that fights and destroy buildings. Such a boring movie. So much CGI and bland story, and cliffhanger OMG. Ridiculous! I love Spiderman movies, and Toby's SM was the best. Followed by that unlikeable Peter Parker in Amazing Spiderman. Homecoming was very good Spiderman reboot. But this boring garbage with ridiculous fights, fire beast and holograms that fights and destroy buildings.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,I am amazed why was this a hit... Maybe people watched it because of endgame. Bit the movie itself was just bad. Wasn't expecting something so crappy,1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,Just when you think marvel cant get any worse they put out this flaming pile of garbage. Everything about this movie is bad from tbe dumb story to tbe awful acting. I can not say one positive thing about this movie even tbe end credit clip is stupid.,1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Quick review. If i was at 9, I would have loved this. With this movie the target audience was obviously children. The jokes were terrible and it felt like watching saved by the bell with spider-man.

J.B. Smooth was the best thing about this movie.

I will give the next one a miss.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the first half was a pedestrian display of Peter's non-superhero life, including his friends and Mary Jane (omg shocked). At their destination, the villain conveniently pops up out of no where and of course Peter is conflicted with assuming the Spider Man persona.

I can't say I've liked a single Spider-Man movie, each one has the exact same story line:
Introduction (repetitive rubber stamp genesis story)
Love Interest (Mary Jane - holy rubber stamp story Batman)


Movie creation people ""WE ALL KNOW WHO SPIDER MAN IS AND HOW HE GOT HIS POWERS"" so please, cut the filler and show a super hero doing super hero feats instead of this low self esteem teenager, groveling and desperate for acceptance.

I grew up watching and loving Spider Man cartoons, comics and overall characterization, so I once was a big fan of the character, huge fan of Marvel, even like Avengers.. but they consistently screw up Spider Man movies like they consistently massacre Super Man movies.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,Better then Homecoming This is one rare time that the sequel is better than the first. I absolutely loved this movie and the pop up surprises just blew me away. This movie has so many dimensions that allow the characters to grow while moving the overall universe forward. Beautifully done and so happy to see Sony actually working with Marvel to produce the best Spider-Man films ever.,1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I think Spider Man should be much more cooler than that, especially in action scenes when he's doing some spidy movements and jumps and stuff. I expect some slow motion acrobatic ducks and dives and shooting webs like the first trilogy starring Tobey Maguire. I mean most of Spider Man fans expect moments when the psychical ability of the hero is challenged, again like in some scenes in first trilogy.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Irresponsible millennial teenager, inherited a huge responsiblity(That can destroy whole world) with Fake nick fury(Real 1 don't give a darn), & a Fake hero (who's a villain), fighting fake holographic monsters!!! Whatt is this Into the Spiderverse is Muchhhh Better than this...",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I was a guest when I went to watch this movie on the big screen. I saw the trailers and I knew (IMO) it was going to suck ass. So I went to watch and it was really predictable boring and pathetic. I left the theater. Now let me tell you I LOVE SPIDER-MAN, he was a childhood hero that I could relate to. I am 20 years old and I still could reflect myself on this character, I really do. In the movies with Tobey Maguire, Miles Morales and heck Andrew Garfield I could reflect myself with their versions of Peter Parker. But with Tom I just can't. Everything that Peter does in this movie is really just pathetic. Like wanting to be an Avenger in the first film, now he just wants to go on vacation. Tony Starks death in Endgame doesn't affect Peter anymore... Yeah... How does this affect Peter... he grieved, sure, but he said he wants to go on vacation and date MJ (Michelle Jones){P.S how does Peter like Michelle now. In Homecoming she like Peter, which was obvious... but here it's vice versa. WTF]. That doesn't mix I am sorry. And with Mysterio Holy Shit he gives Mysterio the glasses Tony GAVE TO HIM to save the world, only 10 minutes they talk and he decides to give it to him. And his otive is nothing but embarrassing, casue of Tony Stark again. I could understand Vulture, in Homecoming, but with Mysterio again the same reason...really???) I don't understand Peter Parker in the MCU, he is an idiot. He doesn't know what ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" (OH Wait I forgot they decide to get rid of Uncle Ben in this universe. For no at all reason...morons) This Peter doesn't grow, he doesn't really change like at all. I don't see him becoming a man, he doesn't grow or change. I knew this movie was going to suck, and I was right, it sucked (IMHO). The only good things in this movie is the action scenes, like that's it, that's all I could say. The MCU ruined the character, and I was sick of it. This isn't Spider-Man, this isn't his actions, this doesn't feel like Spider-Man at all feels like Iron Man Web 2.0. 2/10",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Extremely disappointed, lame story no basis, destroyed all images of avengers. totally non serious boy and his class mates, no acting, like some sort of clown characters, having non serious high school kidos. I simply miss Tobey Maguire spider-man. I wish marvel charge this stupid character with some real boy with real action like in Tobey Maguire spider-man series.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Great visual effects, but this movie is aimed at 8-10 yo children. Spider-mam character is goofy and lame, I am glad this movie finally over.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"This movie is one of the worst marvel movies, i enjoyed Daredevil more than this crap, this is for those who just started watching marvel movies and for little kids. Those who grew up in 80s and 90s reading comics and watching animations know what a real spiderman is.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,This movie is a long Spiderman cartoon that is kind of boring. It would have been better if it were sixty minutes long. The action is not very exciting or creative. The story is incredibly unrealistic and lame. Just a lot of CGI without any substance to it.,1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,This movie was the worst spider man movie at all. Even i rather Amazing spider man 2 than this sh... . Anybody says that this movie was good doesn't know anything about spider man.,1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"If you like school comedy with bad actors reading up from a script and like to see ""actors"" looking in all the wrong directions, because they are just standing in front a green screen, then you will like this ""movie"".",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I never thought I would watch a Spider-Man who was a weak, self-conscious, hormonal, adolescent! The absolutely the worst writing for a superhero movie ever! My family and I would have walked out but we purchased the movie at home! Don't waste your money! Again, absolutely terrible!!!!!!",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I am not even sure where to begin from. Two hrs long movie with such a stupid, boring, regular, old school story, not to mention the awkward acting of mr. Spiderman. The makers failed to give any impression except for the nice graphic designing, which probably is the only 5-10 mins unique part of the movie. The rest is really horrible and I am wondering if the people giving it 7 star have ever watched a good movie?",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I was SO excited to see this! But it was so bad! I fell asleep twice. Even my 9 year old saw through the crappy plot twist. Homecoming was really good, this was a massive step down. Next!",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I could barely keep myself awake through this movie, it was so boring!

The acting was terrible, the CGI was terrible - so much of Spiderman's movements seemed overtly fake.

The story was lame, I was made to believe from the ads and trailers that there would be a multiverse, but it turns out that was all made up.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,If you like a franchise that continues the insecure adolescent and bumbling teen who never matures this is the movie for you. Btw the director is a nobody that tries to interject dumb humor and secondary story lines just to extend a 30 minute spender man episode into movie length.,1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I watched this movie hoping it was an improvement on the last disaster of a spider movie, and I can say in all certainty that this is by far the worst of the whole spiderman movies.

It's more of a coming of age, teenage crush movie, with some spiderman thrown in, what a waste of time and effort from the movie studio, bad predictable story, really not much thought has gone into it, seems that's what Hollywood is about now, pump out films with little or no thought with the same predictable characters and stories.

Don't waste your time on this pointless movie.",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,So far a good franchise is struggling to keep making money bank rolling the characters and brining up out stories out of the brainstorming meeting. Low quality and poor execution of the movie with non believable actions which just doesn't make sense. The number of plot holes with struggle to keep the Frankenstein alive.,1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Some films you stay till the credits have ended some films you can't wait for the credits to start so you can leave . This was the latter .

The first ten minutes were ok - had good humour as soon as they landed in venezia it all went down hill and seemed to be some American cgi fantasy of destroying as much of Europe as possible

You'll be relieved when it finishes - people couldn't get out of the cinema quick enough

I would like to write some positives about Marisa tomsei , Jamie Bell lookalike Jake Gylenhall and Samuel L Jackson but the negatives outweigh the positives so much that it's impossible

Avoid there's nothing worthy in this film at all

Pad.A 1/10",1
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Absolute rubbish. Glad I had my phone to stop me falling asleep. Rated 12 but how would a 12-year old even stay awake? CGI: so bad, it's untrue. Boring. Embarrassing. But worst of all ... Jake? I liked you as an actor. What were you thinking? Paycheck I guess. Still ... nobody died. Or maybe they did, but I'd stopped paying attention. :) Merry Christmas!",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Even with the blip most of the actors look 30+ so it ruined a lot of the immersion. It's also really unbelievable. I know it's a super hero movie but come on. Also I get the jokes, like as if he doesn't look exactly like himself when he uses that crown mask bc in super hero world everybody is oblivious and only used for cheering HAHAHH. No I get it, it's just poorly executed, it's a good idea if it was done right. I'm not offended by this btw, it's a common trope.

Another gripe I had is the actors where too obvious on who they where and didn't line up right in the casting. This to me means bad acting, or just actors who are good but don't do many parts.

The saving grace is his friends who knew who he was and had his back. I liked the interaction change once they where alone with the insiders. Other than that, I didn't make it through the whole movie, the actors being 40 looking ruined it for me.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"As usual nice visuals for the nice budget. Story was predictable. Acting was boring.

Typical American popcorn movie.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"..interesting AND entertaining for wider demographics, became one of those ""teen-movies"", where you know exactly what WILL happen in the next 5-10 minutes increments. But it is not why it's so bad. The acting and the story itself are quite underdeveloped, to say the least. Parker dude himself is trying way too hard to act as an imbecile, so nobody can suspect that he is a ....Spider-man. Overall, it seems that everybody who were involved in the process of making this movie, decided not to sweat to much, because the title grants the pass to the greatness. No, not this time. I could not tolerate 30 minutes of this boring ""masterpiece"". Don't waste your time. Just watch one of the ""Avengers"" one more time))",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Tom Holland is nothing like Spiderman. Tobey was a good peter parker Andrew was a great spiderman

But Tom is none of the above. Plus The New spiderman story is so poor the Writers need to learn something from Spiderman into the spider verse or Spiderman ps4 story.

Also Spiderman is supposed to be Fearless , putting others above himself. But Peter here just wants a date , no matter what happens to the world. And the Fact that Peter here has been spiderman even long before Capital America - Civil war , we should be watching a totally matured spiderman instead we watches a boring teenage athletic kid who just don't wanna be Spider-Man. And when he does He cant do anything and gets his bu.t.t kicked by everyone.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"...this movie is silly. For kids, barely teenagers. Don't waste your time. Stay with the old ones. Shame on them to have messed up so badly.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Just a film I couldn't get into, not sure if it was the change of spiderman , or the lack of acting. I Must of been missing something looking at the other reviews but I didn't watch until the end.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Spider Boy is not a bad film. In fact, it's got a dude dressed in tights shooting sticky goo out of his hand which makes it very epic and acceptable for adults to watch and not look like huge stupid NERDS.

But, its 2019, and Spiderman should have been a women. At least make him gay or transgender, but making him a straight white pre-pubescent boy is woefully behind the times. For this reason alone I do not think it should be nominated for the Grammy's

-Rusty",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Not an absolute terrible movie, but definitely wouldn't want to see it again. Felt like they brought in M. Night Shyamalan to direct. After about the 12th twist and turn it just gets tiring to watch. Like the whole idea of this movie is nothing is as it seems and everything's an illusion. Great premise. I love watching a movie where every 5 minutes they tell you something you just saw wasn't real. Like a high priced magic show. Generally you get done with a movie and you have great scenes you remember that you want to see again. I honestly can't remember one scene like that. Even the crappy superhero movies will have a couple scenes you want to rewatch. I'd say this is probably the worst Marvel movie, just a bit worse than Ironman 3.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Spider-Man far from Home has the worst acting, worst comedy and the most pathetic ending that I have ever seen in a Marvel film to date. The only thing that actually works in this movie is the action scenes that just takes you away from all the crap that Far from Home keeps putting down the audience throat its entire run in over 2 hours off psychological torture that should be abandoned from all cinemas on the planet. Listen we don't need bad movies, we don't need amateurs actors and actress that cant act and we certainly don't need directors and producers that have no passion what so ever in the movie business. I think I'm done ranting for now.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"After all the MCU movies that have been made, the plots are getting predictable, and for some reason they don't change the writing. You know who's going to be the main villain, you know what's gonna happen. It's so BORING! They're all the same..",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"A serious tribute to tony stark, as they use his name in every second line. lousy and kiddish script",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I seldom give such a low rating to a film. This was absolutely rubbish and a waste of time and money. When Marvel remembers nothing but making money, their films are terrible to death. There is no connection between any characters at all. The plot was stupid. Also, could Marvel stop instilling the ideology of bloody Avengers? I felt sick of it. The acting of all actors and actresses is embarrassing. It seems that nobody remembers they are acting instead of having fun.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Another moronic super hero film my kids made me watch. Asinine, puerile and pointless. Avoid at any cost.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,The movie was really boring and so silly Nothing to say more,2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I am truly astonished by all the high ratings/reviews I am reading here. I never saw the movie in theaters because it looked lame from the trailers. So I waited for blu-ray and finally watched it last night.

Correction: I watched the first 40 minutes and then got so bored, almost fell asleep, and turned it off. My wife was bored silly with it also.

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the acting was actually pretty good.

This movie should have been titled ""A Boring High School Field Trip"".

Here is the short list of what is wrong with this film:
Ridiculous, boring plot
Poor dialog
Too far-fetched (a satellite built by Tony Stark and now at the command of Spidey, that can send in drone strikes??)
Gimmicky (the scene where peter is told to take off his clothes, and a fellow student walks in and sees him with a woman - this gimmick is so overused and has been done numerous times in other movies - it's what I would expect maybe from a first-time writer who hasn't yet figure out how to be original)
The big visual CGI scenes seemed forced and simply plunked in between boring plot segments.


How can Marvel make such a lame movie? And why do so many people love it?

Just as a benchmark so you know where I'm coming from, I loved both the Amazing Spider Man movies, and I loved the Toby Maguire spideys 1 and 3. The first Tom Holland spiderman movie was meh-ok, not great. But this one was truly awful.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Ruined Spider-Man that is what happened.

Everything i loved about Spider-Man in the previous movies, has been ruined in the this one.

Instead of a superhero movie, it a teen love-story, between the suddenly very ethnic Mary Jane, and i suddenly very useless Spider-Man...

The effects are not very good either, and vary from Terrible to just plain Bad.

Seems the movie is made for kids, in the ages of 7 to 12, and i have my doubts that even they will enjoy it.

Thank you Marvel, for ruining the last Spider-Man you had the rights to make, but then again you ruined Venom, Thor - Ragnarok, Guardians of the galaxy 2 too, so can´t say i´m very surprised.

This is what happens, when you try to change the fundamentals of what people loved about the first movies...",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Absolutely awful film. Weak plot, annoyingly stupid characters. 2 stars and that's generous.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Forget the first 20 minutes as some have said, you can tell in the first 5 what you are getting. The Second Happy says to Peter (in a sheepish way, sounding like someone's five year old nephew) that ""Nick Fury scares me"", then goes on to flirt like a insecure teenager with Aunt May, pretty much sets the tone for the film- cringeworthy. Far from home, far from ""with great power comes great responsibility."" It is a teenage angst movie, riddled with PC comedy and kids being smarter than adults, characters cast as dark and brooding (Mary Jane) and overall a lackluster film relying on subpar CGI. Disney seems to like writing for kids and teens, which is exactly what this movie is suited for. Slap-stick comedy and an overall lack of caring what happens. Give it a shot, but I do not recommend any type of expectation. Seems more like a reboot than anything resembling what we have seen. This is about as bad as Captain Marvel. Just phoning it in and more focused on teenage hormones, idiot adults, and the title to carry it forward.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,Jake Gylenhall is mediocre as Mysterio. Tom Holland is good at playing the goofy Peter Parker and not much else. When did Spider-Man need stark tech to be a super hero. He doesn't. The crap joke about the spider sense. It's sad when the best scene is the mid credits scene with JK Simmons back as J Jonah Jameson. The only hint of Ben Parker is the initials on peters suitcase. Ben is the reason peter is who he is and why Spider-Man is such a good super hero. MJ is horrible. Zendaya can't act at all. Her lines are dry and without emotion. They need to recast desperately for the MJ character. I don't mind the race change or the fact that her name isn't Mary Jane. All in all this movie is middle of the road and a let down. Should have brought back Michael Keaton as the vulture. He was the best thing about Spider-Man homecoming.,2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,You ruined Spiderman..Shame on you marvel...Worst Marvel movie ever..,2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"This is the second Spider-man movie produced with the help of the MCU team and that is made clear on every step in the movie. There are moments that for those who pay attention are borderline laughable. Lets start with the villain, played by Jake G. a choice i would call briliant for most movies, seems like a quick cash grab on his part, this is again a villain that is more connected to Iron Man than to Spider-man, something we already saw in Homecoming.

Michael Keaton's character was using alien tech and had major beef with Stark, same thing happens here, minus the alient tech.

Spider-man seems neither a hero ,more concerned with his girlfriend, something you will not find in the source material, but the opposite. Everyone that loves Spidey knows he will risk everything to save people and fight the bad guy, even if that means missing a date and having to deal with the ramifications of those constant personal evwent he cant be a part of.

At this point in time MCU movies get free passes from movie critics, so its irrelevant to even bother and reading 90 % of them. The whole thing is being looked at as a TV series, overall great but with some major bad episodes.

Really didn't feel connected to neither the story or the characters in this one.

Dont think ill be seeing any more MCU movies past this one.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"This film start with a video memoriam of the dying superheroes! Captain America survive in Endgame! Why have his picture in this video? I really don't know why! Another not following sequence writing by Marvel film! Suddenly Peter in love with MJ! Happy Hogan in love with Aunt May! This film is about the trip Peter went to Europe and facing a threat from a disguise hero ""Mysterio""! All the joke in the film not even laughable! Hydro giant fighting scene in Venice and fire giant fighting scene in Prague just fancy with CG feel, nothing intense! As turnout all this giant scene is just an illusion by the manipulation of Mysterio tech! He is nemesis of Tony, because Tony fire him! Mysterio just want to deceive Peter to give him the glass with A.I called Edith! The fighting scene when Mysterio disguise as Nick Fury, also not intense enough! Full of nonsense illusion feel! Even the ending fighting scene at London also very ridiculous! Peter constantly shooting by myriad of drone but still can survive! He eventually find the real Mysterio and Mysterio accidentally shot by the drone to death! Before death, Mysterio still can use a gun point at Peter! Lol! Peter grab his gun and he die after that! At the very end, Peter swinging with his beloved girlfriend MJ! That's all! Another cash grab Marvel film from Sony Studio!",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Terrible, by far the worst-ever spider-man. When compared to the marvellous Toby McGuire ""Spider-man 2"", this one fails the stupidity test, the coherence test, the romance test, the dull-fights test, the music test, ... well, it fails in every conceivable way. It can't decide if it's for 12 year olds, 20 year olds, or full adults - and caters for none. I fell asleep twice, once during the big final dull fight scene.",2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,I really hated it! Spending two hours in the theatre watching this film was total waste of time. Suitable for teens 12-15 years old.,2
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Intro:

I had a fun time at the movies watching Spider-Man: Far From Home. I thought the villain was okay. I liked Tom Holland, and I even liked the romance, something the Spider-Man films had a hard time doing well. This film was the best to bridge the gap between Avengers: Endgame, and phase four of the MCU.

Pros:

Mysterio was an good villain, but in my opinion, he was no Vulture. He might even be my favorite of the villains. As we see him bond with Spider-Man, and have a hard time trying to kill him. Which is pretty interesting, but even still, he's willing to step over anybody to get to the top.

I also like how his plan if pretending he's from another Earth, worked in the beginning. As in a world like that, people would believe something stupid like that.

I also think Tom Holland is great as Spider-Man. I think his character arc, taking on the burden of Iron Man, really works.

I also like that this film uses the Spider-Sense. As it was missing in the last film.

I enjoyed the end credits scene as well. Where Mysterio gets the laugh, by revealing a video where he outs Peter as Spider-Man. And frames him for crimes.

I thought Ned was hilarious in this film. And I like the character interactions and to romance in this film, as they all feel like teenagers. And the romance between M.J and Peter feels like a normal teen romance.

Cons:

The film has flaws however, such as, Mysterio's motives. He may have a good performance and I did like his character. His plan has some flaws, like, what would happen after his illusions work? Something would find out eventually. And also, he's evil because Tony Stark used his technology for a different purpose than intended, which is just weak, and feels like a rehash of Iron Man 3.

The movie at times is also very rushed. Like Peter giving Edith to Mysterio right after the fight with the Elementals.

And also, the film trying to trick us into thinking Mysterio is a good guy. It just didn't work for me.

Conclusion:

Spider-Man: Far From Home had it's issues, but I liked it overall. I think it could've been improved in many areas. But the people making the film, still made a descent fillm. It's one of my favorites of the year, but it was still a descent movie.",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"After the Avengers Endgame, this title just seemed very rushed and pointless, no real story, and very weak characters. Love Spiderman movies and all of this series I have enjoyed except this one, like Black Panther this is way over reated. SHAME!!!",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Marvel.. how could cast Jake Gyllenhaal? HOW COULD YOU?! What a horrible actor... in ANY film. This guy needs to be working a regular 9-5 job... not acting in films.

Tom Holland did a fantastic job as he's simply a great actor and clearly dedicated to any role he's playing. The storyline, however, was difficult to follow and all over the place. Worst Marvel movie I've seen. The ONLY bad Marvel movie I've seen. Disappointed.

Again... Jake Gyllenhaal?!!!! What an old, washed up joke of an actor... if you can call him that. No offence but he's NOT superhero material and certainly not Marvel material. He's more DC material! Who's bright idea was it to cast him? Fire them ASAP!",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,This is just stupid. Spider man and all characters act like they are 6 years old. I understand that they want teenagers to watch and adapt to the series and spider man himself is teenager but it was always like this. Spiderman was young but it doesnt act like childish and stupid. They really killed the char in my opinion what a waste,3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Nice at the begin, so much action and of course a lot of fights about Spiderman.",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Do not....I repeat...do jot watch this film unless you wish to be dissapointed. I went to see it with a full heart and came out slightly bitter and emptyhanded. Like one other review said it already....grat movie....if you're 8 years old! I really wanteed it to be good like the first one, but it just isn't. Plot holes all around, the comic reliefs are childish, Jake's caracter is underdeveloped and come on.....Peter gives him acess to the national defense system 2 hours and a drink after meeting him....no one is that naive! The mid credit scene feels like plot twists in 80's comic movies and the post credit scene just doesn't make sense. So....I advise you, do something else with those 2 hours of your life...like...bake a cake instead.",3

Spider-Man: Far From Home,"What on earth was that movie that I have just had to suffer. What a load of total C**P. Was that a failed comedy? Just really rubbish.

Sorry, but that was a rubbish movie.",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"While somewhat entertaining as a family movie this is rather juvenile and aimed at children. If you add in the changes to characters from the original comics to the modern need to tick certain boxes and it all becomes a turn off. Sorry, not for me.",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"How do Marvel fans manage to get excited about such a trivial and sterile film?

I am absolutely not a Marvel opponent, so Batman, Wonder Woman, Arrow and Flash are opposed by Wolverine, Blade, Spidey and the Punisher.

Thanks to films like Wonder Woman and Aquaman, DC has managed to get me excited about films whose heroes I didn't care about before. Marvel, on the other hand, has managed to make me dislike heroes I loved from childhood like Wolverine and Spidey. I also liked the Hulk before he could talk.

I like the Tobey Maquire and the Andrew Garfield movies, but since Spidey moved from Sony to Marvel Studios, he's become nothing but an inconsequential goofball within the MCU.

These films don't put Spidey in a good light and just seem like a billboard for other MCU characters and films in the first place. I would just like to see independent Marvel films again that are more oriented towards the characters from the comics. Something like The amazing Spider-Man, Logan, Punisher - Warzone, Deadpool (part 1) and Blade.

Unfortunately, if I like Spider-Man, I always have to be able to put up with other MCU characters, and that's not easy for me with the best will in the world.",3

Spider-Man: Far From Home,"The Marvel blockbuster success formula is definitely showing signs of wear and tear. While Tom Holland gives an amazing performance, I couldn't connect with the story and side characters. I feel like real character development in those pivotal coming-of-age moment was siderailed for bigger (and also more chaotic) fight scenes.

In contrast, the sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man gave us the best on-screen chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy while Andrew Garfield was also given much better and deeper material to connect with. The scenes in which he struggled with the normal versus the super life were just that much meatier and better handled, not to mention the romance between him and Gwen. That scene at the clocktower will always be my number one Spider-Man moment precisely because of a deeply rich character development and superbe acting performances.

Here's hoping Phase IV will focus more on individual stories and favor character and plot development over bombastic CGI-heavy set pieces.",3

Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Spider-Man must due battle with Mysterio for some reason. Yes, Hollywood's continuity of placating to social justice and intersectional mongoloid fecal matter is more important than being true to the original source.

Yes, watching Spider-soy kicking fake @·· looking ""special"" effects is fun but everything else is AIDS. The acting is horrendously annoying and I think Tom Holland is a ninny.

Spider-Man: Far From Home,Well this Spider-Man series is nothing like the original and how it should be. There is no Harry who is is best friend.

Most characters were somewhat less than interesting. The international locations were one of the few highlights. If you're a Marvel fan, wait for the movie to show up on Blu-ray, streaming or Redbox. If you're not a Marvel fan, skip it altogether. Don't waste your money on this one.",3

Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Movie is too long, drags on and on at times with no apparent reason and feels like it was written for young adults, very childish like movie at times. There were some good scenes but intermittent and usually around scenes of boredom. Guess it had to happen sooner or later and the best by date has expired on Spiderman...",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I am highly disappointed. Spiderman was one of my favorites growing up as a child in the early 90's. I would put this one next to the third Sam Raimi spiderman. It was pretty bad, and that hurts me to say because I love zendaya and marisa tomei. Aunt may's casting has been a struggle for me for a long time with this rendition, it's very hard for me to picture her as anything but over 50 years old. Plot and character development were completely non existent in this film. They tried to mash everything in to this film with so little time. The reality is that this film should have been three hours long. Instead it was just hyper focused on spiderman trying to talk to MJ, just to reveal she pretty much already knew who he was and had a crush on him, which we was revealed in the trailers, so we already knew this going in. I didn't much like Garfield's portrayal of Spiderman either, but both of his films were better than this movie.

Pros: CGI was amazing Acting was very good

Cons: Casting of Aunt May and MJ Character development too many plots not enough time horrible setting",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,Boring . Try to be comedy so over . That's make it sucks . Spider-Man didn't appear in the movie that long . All about teenage comedy movie .,3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"This movie is flat. Spiderman fights drones to save Earth... what a plot. At least marvel should introduce one physically strong villian or some hand to hand strong combat in this film. To destroy drones I don't think any Avenger is needed, millitary or air force is enough. I appreciate the acting of Tom holland. He is perfect in spiderman.",3
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a good movie and a good follow up to the events of Endgame. Here are the negatives. The first 30-45 minutes kinda suck. It's paced awkwardly and incredibly rushed. Scenes just kind of start and stop with no rhyme or reason. It gets a whole lot better after that point though. Peter Parker still MOSTLY has the same internal struggle of Spider-Man: Homecoming. Peter is trying to figure out if he should be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man or be more than that and I wished they had not kept that internal struggle from the first film. Half of the jokes in this movie weren't that funny to me. The visual effects in some areas were a little shotty but most were really good. My final issue is that there is a literal plot device item that comes into play about halfway through the movie and it doesn't make a lot of sense at all for me. Here are the positives. The acting is really good. Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jacob Batalon are standouts from the film. Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Holland have outstanding chemistry together and it's a joy to watch them on screen together. I really hope those two work together again in the future. The rest of the actors do a good job. Most of the visual effects are really good for a Marvel movie. There is a sequence in the film that I think is absolutely amazing that I can't talk about due to spoilers. The Elementals look lifelike and both Spider-Man and Mysterio's visual effects look really good. I absolutely love Mysterio's actual costume. It just looks amazing. The action in this film is really good. You understand what is going on and who is who in each action sequence. I like the story for this film. It has this kind of spy thriller vibe while mixed with a romance comedy that I think works really well together and I like how each destination the group goes to is essential to the plot. I do enjoy the score a lot even though I prefer Homecoming's score. The cinematography is fine. It's not extraordinary but it's decent. The tone mostly remains consistent except for a couple scenes and after the first 30-45 minutes, the film is paced really well. Overall, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a good follow up to Endgame with great acting, action, and good visual effects even if the first part of the film sucks. I give Spider-Man: Far From Home a 7.5/10.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"This film is a big joke. And not even a funny one. The worst Spider-Man film ever made and a bad teen romantic comedy.

✅ Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio (at least until the third act); the locations; the first big battle between SM and Mysterio; good effects.

❌ juvenile and forced jokes every 20 seconds (talking about his aunt shagging someone else during a big fight is bad even for MCU patterns); one of the worst expository dialogue ever (that scene where Mysterio reveals himself...oh boy...""first rule: show, don't tell""); I just zoned out in many actions sequences, as soon as you know the illusion part, it's just repetitive and boring; ""why?????"" - my question to most things happening, the plot seems written after a 30 minutes brainstorming session; exhausting, it feels much more than 2 hours.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Love a superhero movie but this is not aimed at young and old. Gags predictable, comedy childish, and script is nothing special. Good actors doing their best with the material but they cannot rescue this episode of the franchise.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"After the great Avengers ending, and even a well done Spiderman homecoming, this one is quite a step down from the others. Not to say it is a bad movie, as Marvel is largely incapable of making anything less than pretty good. But it is a very uninspired effort, with bland characters and a seemingly plothole ridden pointless story. Don't expect Jake Gyllenhaal to save the movie, as his character wasn't interesting either. Suffice to say this movie was one of the lesser quality flicks in the marvel cinematic universe and should be either a pass or a movie that will be forgotten in weeks, if not days.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Far from being a serviceable film, the latest Spider-Man instead merely serves as a palette cleanser to the Infinity Saga with a half-baked and disjointed story line. Sony has to strike with the Marvel craze while the iron is hot. Definitely one of the worst interpretation of the character in live action.

First off, there are some good elements about this film. Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio brings sympathy, likeability and an underlying sinister element to the character. The design is wonderful owing to its faithfulness to the comics. Outside of the villain, the rest of the film is subpar. Lifting the film can't be done by a single character alone.

The plot of the film follows Spider-Man and his classmates as they travel Europe for a class tour. None of it makes sense. The character does not grow and the different cities have no relevance emotionally and thematically. Setting this in New York City would have resolved this issue. After all, the character lives there. Plot details and decisions matter less over character development. However, the plot here serves little purpose other than to present ""spectacular"" visuals.

Usually, jokes and comedy in the Marvel films land when they serve the characters or are not jarring to the point of being included for the sake of laughs. In here, everything is forced and contrived. Even the awkward teenage love story. Tom Holland and Zendaya, who plays MJ, frankly have no chemistry. Immediately as the film starts Spider-Man is head over heels for MJ who he has shown no liking for in Homecoming. While it is understandable considering the characters are teenagers, infatuation starts from something and this is something the film failed to present. Marrisa Tomei as Aunt May is worse here with her relationship with Happy Hogan, played by Jon Favreau. Teen drama does not mean being dumb down. Maturity can be threaded in the teenage love story without being caricatures.

Thematically, Far From Home is a repeat of Homecoming and it does so on a lesser note. Iron Man is shoehorned, again. Spider-Man now seeks approval and meaning from Iron Man, again. Mysterio and his allies find motivation through Iron Man's past mistakes. It's time for Spider-Man to be his own man as he really is and leave Iron Man alone. Spider-Man is the same character as he was in Homecoming, which is disappointing after four previous appearances in the same continuity. Coming on the heels of Infinity War and Endgame, Far From Home should have explored what it was like for the world to recover after Hulk re-snapping half of the universe, but is mentioned only in passing during the beginning. The film is further hampered by sloppy pacing and editing due to these lapses in story lines. The technical qualities are poor, aside from the score and soundtrack. The CGI is also serviceable at best.

If audiences care about concluding the Infinity Saga, Far From Home is a must watch. But as an engrossing film like its predecessors, it fails.

4/10",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,Why do people are giving this 10 out of 10 I don't see why as far as I'm concerned adjust action action action and the plot is very weak I took a long time to get around to watching this after they killed off Iron Man Robert Downey jr. Had so much charisma as to make everything totally enjoyable this not so much more mundane and everything else,4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"The MCU Spidey's second installment is just another spidey movie for MCU Fans. The only thing best about this movie is the antagonist i.e. Jake Gyllenhaal's ""Mysterio"" and if anyone doesn't know his character that means they are living under a rock, i.e. which already gives away the suspense this movie holds in the middle of the second act. Overall the film can said to be really a ""step up"" far from the first one in the means of action, otherwise the storytelling, the plot, the subplot and the development is very very poor for a ""Spider-man"" oriented movie. The only good scenes are the two scenes, one which we see in the second act and one which comes after the mid credits. The unexpected cliffhanger is just so annoying as the one which we saw in the end of the first movie. In the end, it's just a movie for a better treatment after the dealing with MCU's infinity saga's conclusion.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Looks like marvel can't make original content same movie over and over again superhero ""Spider-Man"" gets beat up by super bad guy ""can't remember bad guys name (it's that bad)"" and spider man almost loses. Then magically something happens to make Spider-Man invincible and he beats the bad guy up the end.

This is one of thoses movies you forget about what happened in it and the characters names 1 week after seeing it.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I should start off by saying that I wasn't a fan of Homecoming. I thought it was fine as a film but I didn't like it as a Spider-Man film. I didn't like the direction of Spider-Man himself. This time round, I don't like Far From Home as a film. The film is enjoyable but not very well made in my opinion.

The film starts with the ""in memoriam"" scene which is basically a comedic recap of the events of Endgame. If you were a big fan of Endgame you would probably find this scene distasteful, but I think that Far From Home is it's own film and it's showing that it wants to be a comedic sequel to Endgame, that's fine. Then we get a scene with Peter being asked if he's going to be the next Iron Man and then mourning his death, that's also fine, that's amazing in fact, a film about that would be great. Then we get a comedy scene, then a scene about the field trip, then a scene about Peter not wanting to be Spider-Man, then a scene about Peter talking about wanting to seduce MJ (for some reason) and then... this film doesn't know what it wants to be. Maybe the secret genius of this film is making you feel like Spider-Man by giving you whiplash from the bad pacing and amount of tone shifts.

Speaking of Spider-Man, he's pretty much a shell of what he was. I can't tell if this is supposed to be a new character or if I'm supposed to use my knowledge of previous versions of the character from the prequel or comics to understand his motivation. It seems like sometimes the film is telling me ""you're supposed to treat him like a new character, it doesn't matter if the Spider-Man you know wouldn't do this"" and at other times ""this is the Spider-Man you already know, you're supposed to connect the dots to understand where he's coming from"". It's just bad writing in my opinion. They reduced his character in Homecoming to a caricature. He's not the only one to get this treatment though.

Just about every character in Homecoming feels like they've been reduced to caricatures in this film. Although I'm not a fan of Homecoming, the film did well at planting seeds for it's characters. For example, why did MJ like Peter yet was so distant towards him? why was Flash so desperate for validation and jealous of Peter? why was May so worried about Peter sneaking out and what would happen if she found out he was Spider-Man? well, we didn't find out and probably never will, we didn't find out and probably never will and we didn't find out and probably never will. Not only did the film not take advantage of those seeds Homecoming planted, it poured salt on them. They're all 1 dimensional in the film. Even Nick Fury is weirdly written and they try to excuse it with year 3 creative writing techniques by saying he was an alien the whole time, which means nothing, it doesn't change anything. This film uses excuses and illusions to make you think their lazy writing is better than it is, and their villain is a good example of this.

Mysterio isn't a good villain in my opinion. I don't understand why he blows up cities and bridges. I don't understand how his motivation links into that. I don't understand how Tony Stark calling his invention BARF is even a motivation. The only thing I can think of to connect those dots is him being unstable, which is just bad and lazy writing in my opinion. Unstable villains can be great, I mean look at The Joker, Doc Ock and Killmonger. They all have clear end goals and a good motivation that pushes them to wanting to achieve that end goal but their broken world views and moral compasses cause them to go about it in morally incorrect ways. Mysterio just wants to blow stuff up because Tony Stark called his invention BARF a couple of years ago. Also apparently people actually found the campy reveal and exposition scene shocking. I don't want to insult anyone but if you've watched any Disney film, you would've known the overly nice guy is the villain. If you watched/read/researched any other Spider-Man media with Mysterio, you would've known he was the villain. If you noticed that the film has no villain yet and the only new character introduced is the guy who came out of nowhere, you would've known he was the villain.

This film feels like it was directed by Mysterio at times. Not just because 90% of it looks fake, but also because the film is sprinkled with events to give off the illusion that it's important and worthwhile. For example: it has answers about some questions from Endgame just thrown in there, MJ and Peter get together without it feeling earned, the two post credit scenes are seemingly important for future films, etc. We could've been shown those scenes on their own and it would've had the same impact. The only thing this film has to offer ,other than those events, are the cool illusion scenes and forced MCU humour. The story is plot hole ridden and weak, the characters are weak and the hero doesn't evolve, grow or learn anything new.

In conclusion: I think it's hard to enjoy this film as a Homecoming fan, Endgame fan or as a Spider-Man fan. It's still enjoyable but my god it's soulless and lazy. I imagine this went through production hell. There's a couple things I didn't mention like turning Spider-Man into Iron Man and the amount of plot holes and coincidences but I think this'll do.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"What is worst than one Spider-Man movie? Two Spider-man movie. This movie is miles worst than its predecessor. It works as a teen comedy especially the first half of it. After awhile it became really boring and predictable despite the illusion that Mysterio brings. Same with the action scene, it's overloaded with noise and chaos and CGI that ultimately become its strongest weakness.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"From the poorly cast MJ , to the the weak story this was a very poor MCU entry, bordering on Ironman 3 and Thor Dark World. It's a shame. Sometimes a movie can be too meta and this was certainly a case. I love Spider-Man, but sorely disappointed with this one.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Are no where near as good as the Toby Maguire versions. The first film with Maguire is still the best Spiderman film. This new version is just silly, a dumb villain, bad jokes, and underwhelming actors. And what's awful is teenagers continue to see these types of films so they continue to get made. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.

FINAL VERDICT: Just skip it. Lots of better action films out there.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"When I first walked into the cinema, I had high expectations for this movie. I mean, having seen all the trailers and TV spots a billion times, who couldn´t? Spiderman Far From Home was set to kick start a new era in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but instead, it just made me wish I could go back in time and un-see it. The first trailers gave us an insight in what could possibly lead into a multiverse. Not only was this fake, but it also crushed any possibility for Sony to have a viable excuse to integrate Miles Morales and the Osborn duo to the MCU. But these are not all the disappointments. The movie relies heavily on comedy, trying to make the fans laugh to distract from the fact that Ned, a kid who was able to hack into Stark Level technology, is put off as a lovesick sidekick who does nothing to help Peter with his troubles until the last ten minutes of the movie. Furthermore, his troubles commence with Parker´s idea to tell MJ that he likes her. Since when? In Homecoming, Zendaya´s character appears five times at most, often making fun of Peter in a teasing manner. So, with no extra footage of how they got talking or how on Earth both him and Ned know her favorite flower and why, we´re expected to believe that he´s into her? Talking about out of the blue romances, where did Happy and May come from if both only met shortly after the events of Endgame. Moving on, the whole plot of the movie is based around Peter falling into Tony´s legacy, ignoring the fact that Peter is his own person. Along these lines, every mention of Tony´s late mentor gave a chance to explore Spiderman´s PTSD and Anxiety over the events of his last 3 movies, from a warehouse falling on him to the death of hist most recent father figure. To be honest, the only thing that really salvage is Happy´s relationship with Peter. Hogan respects the kid and helps him figure himself out while nudging towards the kind, thoughtful and strong person he is destined to become. The first post-credit scene, while entertaining, also left a sense of unfulfillment from the movie. Yeah, who didn´t want a J. Jonah Jameson in the movie? But that didn´t mean we wanted Peter´s identity exposed. So, what, is he going to run around mask less now? The final scene, on the other hand, is actually funny, while not leaving any loose ropes. To conclude, the movie shows (while not even putting the quote in) that with great power comes great responsibility. And apparently, Kevin Feige and John Watts weren´t able to handle it.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Like the Mysterio angle in this one, but Peter Parker is still pining after Tony Stark, the SpiderSense still missing for some strange reason, Peter Parker can't figure out the simplest of ways to test new equipment ( he is a genius in his own right), and makes terrible common sense decisions.

This version of Spider-Man was bad in the first movie and remains terrible. Not sure what Marvel universe this Spider-Man came out of but it seems to be the stuck adolescence of middle school.

Can we get Andrew Garfield back now that Sony and Disney are on the outs. At least Andrew has some acting chops. I can't figure out Tom Holland.. he is not that good.

Best part of this is Mysterio and it would be nice to get a Spider-Man movie with Spider-Man.. not Iron Man worked into everything (this is why it's not a Spider-Man Movie and neither was the first one)",4

Also spider man suit is to robotic and not anything like the original suit which means he gets l his powers except his super strength and senses from the suit and he really is annoying in this one I miss Toby maguire he is and always be the only true spider man",4

Compared to all the spectacular fight scenes and the gritty feeling of Endgame, this just feels like a kids movie. And for the love of Stan Lee, get rid of the guy playing Flash. Jesus.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Aside from some humorous moments between Parker and Happy, this one is quite dull.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"The pros: Likeable Holland.

Zendaya grows on you in the 2nd film.

Jake is always a plus

The cons: Annoying friend.

Magic drones.

Sub par plot.

Tony Stark constant memoriam.

Annoying May.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"The storyline is patchy. The drone act is rather far-fetched even for a sci fi fantasy flick. The character development is ify. Spiderman not wanting to be a superhero, combined with his naivety in handing over Ironmans legacy does not auger well for superheroes and there logic circuits. Come on guys 'Night Monkey'......",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"I thought this was another Disney Marvel film because of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). The Columbia Pictures Torch Lady in the opening scene just didn't register with me right away but I knew something was really off in this film. The film is extra cheesy. Looks like Sony ordered extra cheese on it. It just didn't feel like a Disney Marvel movie. It wasn't until the end credits that I realized this was a Sony Picture. Ironically, I think it's more ""Disney TV-G"" for Disney Channel than Disney Marvel movies.

I really didn't like it. It was disappointing. This picture should have been split up into five parts and made into a mini Netflix TV season because it has more of a made for television Je Ne Sais Quoi than silver screen material. I am surprised it is rated PG-13, but I think it might be for some very few sexual innuendos in the dialog otherwise it's a TV-G. I can't see adults liking this film. Last year's animated ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)"" is a far better movie than this live action film with CGI draped spiderman suits.",4
Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Post credits almost as entertaining as the rest of the film.

Entertaining, YES. Original, NO.

The film is simply another paragraph to the marvel storybook, in a two hour action film format.

Worth watching, sure, but wasn't worth my movie ticket.",4
The Fate of the Furious,How infuriating this bonal thriller after the 5th part is almost no races of cool cars all the bonal even fix I do not want would be a stone beka can another movie about cars do,1
The Fate of the Furious,"This movie is terrible, so many people are saying how great it is, bit really it's not. Too many now they have gone from illegal street racing, doing up cars and such, too utter crap. Stupid over the top crap, stupid story, stupid in believable non realistic crap. Just taking the piss out of a once good franchise.",1
The Fate of the Furious,Never has so much acting talent been wasted on such a stupid plot.,1
The Fate of the Furious,"This movie is redundant in the whole of the francise its also the most ridiculous yet. I love it don't t take it seriously.

Hobs and shaw ftw.",1

The Fate of the Furious,"After 7 episodes this one still have graphics of a Cheap video game, that with millions earned from episodes before.",1
The Fate of the Furious,This is the worst of the Fast and Furious story lines ever. There is no way that Dom worth have let his son get captured! I won't recommend this film to anyone and should be cut from the whole franchise,1
The Fate of the Furious,"Why are people still watching this rubbish The first movie wasn't any good

Dom Dom it's about family No it's about money

I wonder if Vin Diesel will ever look back and wonder why he spent decades on this crap.",1

The Fate of the Furious,"We'll keep on rating bad for this cheap shallow, kinda reapeatative movies, left leaving no sense.",1
The Fate of the Furious,"Watched 2 days ago. The worst movie ever! What is the small kid doing here if Brian's kid goes to school? He is just older this kid for 1 year, but Elena's child is only 6 months.

Logic",1
The Fate of the Furious,"How did this movie box over a billion? It is so boring. I did not like Charlize Theron's part at all. Too much dialogue, that really goes nowhere. Too many scenes are beyond suspending disbelief. I agree with other reviewers that this is the worst of the series!",1
The Fate of the Furious,"Previous movies of Fast and Furious was masterpieces and I really enjoy it so much that I have seen two or three times.

This one is a huge dissapointing with so many reasons: stupid and not believable scenes , awful dialogues and the appearence of the worst and most hated actress Charlize Theron why the bring this awful actress in the movie ? In every action movie the only thing that she can make is to ruin it.",1
The Fate of the Furious,"It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I have seen plenty of bad movies. There's nothing to write about this film. I'm not a big fan of the series, but I regret spending my money to watch this film.",1
The Fate of the Furious,"How a franchise continue without 50% of his main players ?? Well, money grab eh !!! And the proof here with the worst film of the franchise yet !! Everything has disappear all of sudden. Lack of chemistry, no actual plot ! Add a random villain, Kurt Russell glorified cameos appearances.... lack of Tyrese joke... Vin Diesel doing nothing except playing the tweeter and in a real bad way, he is not convincing every minute of the film ! The Rock Dwayne Johnson acting like a really goofy 320 pounds of steroid freak !! Should tone down in his next films, he looks absolutely ridiculous ! We know he is muscular, he don't need to weight Vin Diesel and Jason Statham combined weight ! The film is a major disappointment compared to the Furious 7 film. Maybe the fact that Paul Walker was such a big deal in theses films don't help for a sequel this soon.... but trust me, it's not good ! The stunts are, the film is not !",1
The Fate of the Furious,"Mix SFX with non stop talking and you've got a ""fast and furious"" movie. This movie may appeal to the youth but definitely not to a mature viewer. Weird and funny acting with bad direction. Even the baby raising his hand was done with CGI. A couple of good chase scenes but definitely not recommended!",1
The Fate of the Furious,"This drifter is not exactly what I had in mind or to put it mildly, I just was not in the frame of mind for a such. Nor will I ever for that matter. Meaning, I prefer a summer-breeze drifter cruise down French coast or a Sport Utility Vehicle drifter which I had myself already without films or reality shows of this kind. Walker is dreadful even for Johnny handsome and Vin Diesel is completely cancelled due to his nonsense of prefering an erased Beyonce's shape and an erased musical opus.",1
The Fate of the Furious,Seriously this film has nothing fast. Seems another different film,1
The Fate of the Furious,"I only wish I could rate this trash less than 1 star.... Just suffers from ""Call-of-duty-itis"" from start to finish, the same recycled nonsensical crap over and over and over again....

Always remember guys, every single time you pay money to see a movie like this you're spoon feeding the film industry money to keep making more movies of this calibre. boring, seen it all before, overrated garbage. absolute waste of brain cells even thinking about seeing this movie.",1
The Fate of the Furious,"...but that was a long time ago.

It started off as a story about pretty normal people in the under world and a cop who got too emotional attached to the group he infiltrated.

Even the more extreme sequences of the first movie felt close to reality.

Now we're at movie number eight, and it went from realism to another Marvel production with super humans.

Compare the first movie to this one, and you'll realize that it's not even the same type of a movie.

Road racing is more or less gone and it's just pure meaningless action without a real story.

I would have loved to see a sequel of the first movie. Something that followed that path instead of just explosions, steroid pumped men and impossible stunts.

A movie where a punch in the face meant that you fell to the ground and men couldn't walk through walls.

The only fast and the furious is in my opinion the first one. And from movie number three it's just an alternative Avengers...

So sad how they killed it.",1
The Fate of the Furious,They should just have stopped at 2 Fast 2 Furious. How do they even get to the Sub at the end? Please make it the last of the Furious franchise.,1
The Fate of the Furious,"I guess the director and writers just gave up on reality and decided to go all in with this, James Bond, Inception Twilight Zone themed thing.

For those die hard F&F fans, this is probably the greatest thing to hit the silver screen, but this is not for those of us who prefer to stay more grounded in reality. I like Statham and Johnson, but I guess they just did this for the money or the fun of it.

Visuals effects: are fun as usual. Logic defying, but fun. 7 Acting: is a sold negative 5 all around. Plot: is a 5. Overall logic: At this point, this is an alien word for the franchise so, negative 25.

The first 2 F&F movies were the best. This franchise has just gone downhill from there. Don't spend money watching this. You will feel dumber by the end of it.",1
The Fate of the Furious,It's so bad I don't know where to start...I'm glad I didn't pay to see it lol Was the screenplay wrote by a 5 year old..I know films can be far fetched but this is completely brainless...the caricatures are too over the top Macho...with some of the most ridiculous lines ever said by actors The action just doesn't make sence .it's so boring...all the money and technology can not make it a good film,1
The Fate of the Furious,"Take every type of cheese and mash it together and you have this film. Talk about drivel, this film is taking it to new heights. From really unbelievable ""female hackers"" to cheesy idiotic accents, to just logically flawed scenes this film fails to even make sense half the time and the rest of the time its just incredibly cringe-worthy.

Add to that all the school grade so called humour and fight scenes and you really limit the audience to those under 10 years old. I don't know how this did in the cinema but if it did well it doesn't bode well for society.",1
The Fate of the Furious,"This film is just so absolutely lame, crap and just pure trash. They shouldn't have done a Fast and Furious 8 without Paul Walker who unfortunately died. He was the star of the Fast and Furious films not that absolutely far too overrated idiot Jason Statham. I wish i could have given this film 0/10 because that's what is deserves because it is the worst Fast and Furious film of the series. This is just pure crap and is so damn cheesy.",1
The Fate of the Furious,"Fast and the Furious with a mix of World War Z in it. Weak jokes, super powered humans, and oh I forgot, another epic chase scene that last forever.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"If you love realistic action sequences and to be sucked into a film stars performance, look elsewhere. Unnecessary use of fire, cringeworthy script. Absolutely zero emotion from Charlie Theron or Vin Diesel (even worse than usual). The Rock playing his usual cocky jocky self. Jason Statham was one of the better parts of the film.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"In this time of covid i finally have some time to this movie, and to be blunt it sucks...hard. The opening of the movie set the tone for the rest of the movie, Toretto started out as a wannabe gangster robbing trucks and is now considdered a racing god known all over the world. He can take any car he wants and defeat any car he comes across, because its not about the car but the racer. I facepalmed myself so hard that i know have a week old headache.

It would be best to lay this franchise to rest, its become a show of things that are impossible. In a race you set the motor on fire, just drive backwards and defeat the most fasted car on the island with the slowest. Yes, this actually happens.

This whole movie is stupid and a waste of time, very bad cinematography, no humor, horrific acting and a laughable 'story'. This franchise has become an insult to tge movie industry. I am done with this entire franchise.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"Despite the fact that Dom chose to go rogue instead of asking his team for help, this movie still had potential. That potential died with Cipher.

She talks way too much and is completely monotoned. It's an excruciating headache to listen to her.

Also, the opening scene is a complete waste of time. Had no relevance to the story whatsoever.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"They've completely ruined the whole franchise. It's not even about cars. I can't even see how this is a franchise that started out as a Street Racing franchise. I 've see War/Action movies which don't have as much explosions and shooting. The movie was unenjoyable. Haven't seen a movie, which I want to turn off in the first minutes, in a long time. I just spent 2 hours of my life that I'm not getting back.

I don't think that they will ever go back to their roots and make a Fast and Furious movie, that is gonna be all about racing and not about family or blowing the whole city up and fighting against a villain, who has a plan to blow the whole world up. I'm very disappointed to what has happened to this franchise.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"The Fate of the Furious is the 8th movie in the Fast and Furious franchise. It somehow made it that far. But at least it's fun. It's really stupid and cringy at times, but it's not to be taken seriously. Still, I think everyone is way too gentle on these movies.

So, once again, it's basically a B-movie script with a big budget. And the previous movie was surprisingly touching with its tear-jerking tribute to Paul Walker and I think it should have stopped there. This isn't even funny anymore, it's just a pointless cash-grab now. When it shouldn't be funny, it is. And when it should, the jokes fall flat. And you end up cringing through the movie. It was fun, yes. But it never should have made it this far! This is way too much for such a stupid franchise and everyone is more gentle then they should be. There are lots of better movies that are taken too seriously and get mixed or negative reviews. And this rubbish gets praised. Maybe I'm overreacting, but I think it's really the time that it stops. It's not awesome anymore in any way, it's just really, really dumb at this point.

I don't recommend this. Don't go see it. That probably won't stop the franchise from continuing, but you have better things to do and better movies to watch.",2
The Fate of the Furious,2 seconds worth to be watched the one it started and the one it ended.,2
The Fate of the Furious,"The longer you watch the worse it becomes! And to top it off it has all the acting prowess of the ROCK and Vin Diesel. Who will win the oscar first?! I can't describe how poorly wriiten this is without getting into endless spoilers, which would require me to relive this pice of crapola. On a philosophical note, this is a movie that makes murdering look morally right. The good guys are bad guys, and in a different time I could go along with it for fun, but 1.) this movie is too dumb to be fun and 2.) our current political times of equating might with right, ruins that equation.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"The Fast and the Furious had some really good moments over the years. ""The Fate"" is sadly an all time low: bad script, bad story, bad ""all star"" acting, bad soundtrack and the worst abuse of physics and other natural laws ever. An atomic submarine can swim faster than a sports car can drive? (No, speed record is 65kmh) How about not only hacking thousands of cars in seconds, but also coordinating them exactly...done by one person? A C-movie blown up to AAA with money, name and stars.

An all time low, insulting every sense. Watch it at home, drunk and sleepy, you will maybe like the explosions and countless deaths with not a single drop of blood. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 👎👎👎 PS. Postproduction is really great, one of the best colors and contrast I ever saw in a movie. Sadly wasted.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"I can't wrap my head around how this movie earned 1.2 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. Most of the world is smarter than this, right? I can't tell you how bad this film is. On every level. Just a complete waste of time. Full of senseless action scenes. I love Summer popcorn flicks. But this isn't even that. If you hate plots, acting, characters and logical sense, it's great. If editing and plausibility makes no difference to you, knock yourself out.

These movies are not supposed to be James Bond or super hero movies. There is no possible way most of it can ever happen. Most of it doesn't even make sense. All of it is LOUD and obnoxious. It's all just car chases and explosions and a few passing scenes of bad acting. Nothing else.

If you have half a brain, skip it. Hopefully this is the end of Furious. I won't be watching another one. Even for free.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"This movies series has become some sort of a parody, a non-sense not funny parody.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"Absolutely boring. Except from the scenes where Vin Diesel & Jason Statham are escaping from prison ALL THE OTHER FILM is crap and boring. First of all the story does not make any sense. Vin Diesel (DOM) is betraying his ""Family"" because ""bad woman"" Charlize Theron kidnapped his ex-girlfriend and his... kid? Sooo, Dom decides to betray everyone, kill almost everyone of his ""Family"" just for an infant that he never knew it existed??? instead of preparing a rescue mission for his ex-girlfriend and kid (Which BTW he never knew it existed before but he suddenly started crying for this kid). Such a horrible story & scenario. All the stunts are unrealistic in all the series but this time its a joke! They try to get away from submarines, Russian soldiers, and stopping torpedoes with their.. hands. Try to win sympathy with Jason Statham looking silly with an infant and doing stupid grimaces. FAIL movie!",2
The Fate of the Furious,"The dialogue was obviously definitely phoned in and so cheesy, you could see the actors grimacing. All the dialogue except for that of Charlize Theron. It was like she had a completely different writer, and she pulled off the icy, evil role of Cypher perfectly. The Helen Mirren and Jason Statham roles, and the interactions they had with other cast members, kept the movie afloat when there weren't car races, chases, and crashes. And there were lots of them. Which, if the car action is the only reason you are watching the series at this point, you will not be disappointed. But whoever thought it would be a good idea to have Vin Diesel speak Spanish, or attempt drama, or acting on a higher level than ""race car driver"" should never work in movies again.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"At this point, there is almost nothing real left in the Fast and Furious franchise except its readiness to offer the ever increasing number of actors their annual bonus for showing up for a day in front of the green screen and the palpable attraction between Tyrese and Eastwood. Everything else is so artificial, calculated, worn-out and void of any emotion that anyone looking for an actual movie needs to look elsewhere.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"I like all the previous movies despite the nonsense sometimes. But this one, it was painful to watch. Extremely disappointed of Charlize Theron, her character was very cartoonish, and her criminal organization did not even make sense. She just made this movie for the money and the reputation of the series, I am sure. She may be the lamest bad guy of any movie. Spoilers, Who finances her airplane anyway? And where do they land without police interference? Statman was the only good thing of this movie. And how the heck Vin Diesel changes personalities just like that? What a pu**y! And Theron plastic surgeries were very distracting as well!",2
The Fate of the Furious,"This movie was awful.

The scenes in Cuba were in tune to the previous movies up until we meet Cipher. While the FF movies are not exactly realistic, Toretto winning the race backwards is not the most unrealistic thing i have seen in these movies.

When Cipher is introduced the illusion is shattered. Toretto begins talking and acting in a way which he as a character would not do in any previous movie. He seems nervous and jumpy instead of cool, calm and collected. The same goes for every other character in the movie. Hobbs and Shaw go from serious hardened characters to children arguing about who is stronger, while evidently forgetting why they hate eachother. Tej and Parker are so awkward, injecting unnecessarily cringy comments for ""comedic release"". Usually they are quite cheesy, but this is worse, for whatever reason.

Furthermore, it seems that the actors have completely forgotten how their characters behave. There were so many moments when one reaction from a character would be entirely lacking in emotion, not selling the scene at all. Its almost as if their hearts are not in it.

Another gripe is Shaw being allowed into the group after killing Han just one movie earlier. Did they forget that or do the just not care?

Also, the pacing of the movie is completely off. WHen the ginger is about to snipe Letty from the hood of Toretto's car and he is interupted, that fight is ended in almost one blow. Something which could have had such an impact on the trajectory of the story was just ended right there.

Finally, the realism in this, even for a FF movie is a stretch.

I don't recommend this movie and hope the next installments are not like it.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"I guess there is a reason I have never really wanted to see Fast & Furious 1 thru 7. I had heard they weren't very good and although I like action movies and they have been playing F & F 1 thru 7 on all the movie channels for the past year I just wasn't compelled to watch them.

I was really hoping that Fast & Furious 8 was going to make me wanna go back and see all the rest. I am a big fan of The Rock, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Ludicrous, Charlize Theron and even Kurt Russell (not a Vin Diesel fan although his performance as Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy was spot on :-) but this movie was stupid from the get go.

I mean at least these guys are getting PAID big time......but it doesn't make this any less trashy.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"I just gave it one star bonus because of the Dom's line at the end - ""Everyone, meet Brian."" And one for my favourite Dodge car. That was the most stupid action I've ever seen! Flying cops, doors open itselves when you need them, car blockade, submarines, tanks... Where is gone the classic care racing? Where is the adrenaline above the money hi tech toys and driving skills? I hope Paul Walker is not watching from somewhere, because he will feel betrayed. You guys betrayed the family, the idea of brotherhood, the racing and the atmosphere of this movie at all. You lost my respect, all of you.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"I used to love Fast & Furious franchise, but after 4th installment it became so outlandish and not plausible, that I feel like star trek movies are more grounded in reality than this current franchise. Movies are so over the top bad that it doesn't hold my attention longer than 30 min and it was a struggle ever since. Seriously, they took a racing small potatoes outlaws movies and turned into international super spy society. Terrible and unfortunate, it seems there's no reason to keep watching them anymore, at least for me.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"This series should be called ""the undying squad"". In my opinion, this is probably the worst series ever made. lots of wasted money on the same BS. Bunch of street racers are better than every police and military forces on earth. Despite that they out numbered 1 to 100, before you even watch, you know they are going to win without any of them dying. It is very predictable. Not just that, they destroy an entire city, hundreds of people dye, but none of them gets even detained at the end. They steal to secret info for personal motivation, but it's OK. The amount of BS in this movie is limitless.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"What do you get when you have a bunch of actors, loud sound effects, dumb nonsensical plot line, unfunny jokes, over the top bad acting, ridiculous unrealistic action scenes...You get the latest fast and furious movie. There is no reason this movie should have been made other than to make money off of mindless people. I am so glad I didn't pay to see this. The terrorist role played by Charlize was boring, why did she want to destroy the world? Through out this movie I kept asking myself, ""Why?"" Another common thought was, ""this is stupid"". If you have a brain with common sense, don't waste the time you can't get back watching this ""movie"".",2
The Fate of the Furious,The Fate Of The Furious let's get in how bad this movie was the story and plot was awful again the acting in this one was bad this is the worst entry in The Fast & Furious Series.,2
The Fate of the Furious,"I am continually baffled by the popularity of this series. It's not that I don't like dumb action movies. If you want to run a marathon of c-grade Van Damme and Seagal movies, I'm in. I'll bring the beer and we'll have ourselves a night. The problem here is that the characters in these films are the worst humans on the planet outside of terrorists. These are the people that pull into the bar parking lot doing 80mph in 10-year-old BMWs, order a round of Fireball shots, put $50 of worth of Drake on the jukebox and ask the bartender to crank it while everyone else in there is trying to watch a ballgame. These characters are the dregs of society and I got tired of their nonsense five movies ago. And yet here I am reviewing part 8. Because I'm an idiot.

Anyhoo, when we last left the gang they had crashed some cars in an unlikely fashion and Vin Diesel mumbled some hackneyed crap about family. Picking up from that cliffhanger, we find that Dom (Vin Diesel) is now being blackmailed into turning on his friends by a hacker named Cipher. No, really, her freaking name is Cipher. So, Mr. Nobody (tragically played by Kurt Russell, who deserves better) brings together Dom's old team to stop Dom and Cipher before they gain control of a nuke. Did Dom really turn on everyone? Is the old gang really being torn apart? Were you dropped on your head repeatedly as a child? If the answer to the last question was ""no,"" then there is likely little suspense to be gained from the first two questions.

These movies don't really lend themselves to coherent analysis, as they are mainly excuses to put good-looking people in stupid action sequences while occasionally yelling something inane for the trailers. As such, I just have a few random thoughts. First, these movies actually became more entertaining when they introduced The Rock and Jason Statham, which is likely because they have more charisma than any of the original cast. Unfortunately, they are sidelined for much of this entry and we are left with the nonexistent suspense of Dom's story for much of the running time. That makes this far less entertaining (and I use that word loosely) than the last couple of movies. Second, the movie doesn't even have as many extravagant action scenes as the last couple of films. As dumb as Furious 7 was, it at least through increasingly preposterous action sequences at you constantly. That distracted the audience from the plot, which was a good idea. With fewer distractions, one has more time to think about things and that is not a luxury with this series. Finally, this movie has an almost adorably quaint concept of hacking. Cipher (seriously, her name is Cipher) can literally hack any machine on the planet with a few keystrokes. I wondered if the producers went back to 1995, grabbed the guy that wrote Hackers and asked him to write this script without any updates about how this stuff actually works. They should have just cast Angelina Jolie and made her the same character from Hackers. I at least would have gotten a laugh out of that.

I don't like this series, but this may be the worst one of the bunch. The action scenes are surprisingly dull, the characters are awful and the writers seem to have even stopped trying. I just wanted it to end. Dear god, did I want it to end. But don't you worry, Fast & Furious fans. Parts 9 and 10 already have release dates set. So do some exhaust work to your Jettas, blast some Chance the Rapper tunes and your heroes will be back before you know it. I need a drink.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"Watched this movie twice and I really tried to make something out of it but to no success. So, the main character is enjoying a life of passion and danger when a blond woman appears and makes him take on a secret assignment high risk job where he becomes the villain but comes out on top in the end... Come on, Vin, yon can do much better than that and you can also do this in one movie a year instead of two. I really need to see a movie about cars, races and the boys being boys just like it was in the good old days. 2001 wasn't that long ago and the first movie in the franchise will remain a classic. What we got in 2017 was an ugly patchwork of the worst Bond movies, Bollywood car stunts, bad CGI and awkward clichés. I give this one 2/10 instead of 0/10 for the baby scene on the plane at the end of the movie.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"I remembered that 3rd part of this movie ""Tokyo Drift"", was lots of fun, so I convinced my wife to see the 8th part. What a pile of crap we saw! It started with a traditional racing, which was fun but, after so many movies about the same thing, felt quite trite, to be honest. Even colorful Cuban landscapes and passionate Latin themes didn't help. My wife called that part ""chuleria del barrio"" (a neighborhood childish put on). Producers knew that and, apparently, decided they needed to raise stakes so the movie quickly shifted into the terrorism domain. Taking into account the caricature nature of the franchise which, at the same time, pretended to be a kind of serious, the attempt was moronic from the very beginning but got worse with every turn. Protagonists first invaded Germany (Berlin) and later Russia (some Northern military base). Both times they wrecked havoc having fun killing locals. Both time locals had nothing to do with what was happening. American villains fought with American ""supermen"" on a foreign territory. After each firework and significant body count, either American villains or American ""supermen"" celebrated the victory. Locals just depicted a stupid cannon fodder with zero initiative. Their role was to appear with a gun or a ""chainsaw"" (if they were big enough) and die for American fun. Stunts and fistfights were impressive (Statham is a big talent) but the sheer lunacy of the events didn't let me enjoy the action part much. Racing, the core of the franchise, already too far-fetched to be the central part of a terrorist plot, didn't save the day because the sound in the cinema was deafening. Whenever protagonists cranked up their engines, I would start praying to have it finished before my eardrums explode. I especially remember the last scene of the movie when complacent American warriors gathered on a rooftop of a skyscraper in New York to celebrate their victory and talk about family values. Never mind they have just killed, at least, a hundred innocent Russians, who tried to save their military base from the invasion. Of course, in the mind of movie makers, those poor chaps deserved to die. Why not? After all, they were unable to protect their nuclear submarines from cunning American terrorists. If it wasn't because of the USA, the world would have ended in nuclear convulsions pretty soon. The message is clear: die poor barbarians, that's your Fate of the Furious while we, an uber-nation, continue breed and prosper.",2
The Fate of the Furious,"Wow this was a wierd film i saw 2 versions of this on dvd the theatrical & directors cut.i have to say 2017 was not a good year for vin diesel not box office vice i mean as film quality vise both xxx 3 the return of xander cage & this film fast n furious 8 aka fate of the furious are average films .with no repeate value .all action & style but no good story or even a decent villian i mean look at this film why did they hire charlize theron for just because she won a oscar.in acting these guys wasted her talents & she did nothing here only sitting at computer blowing things up a cyber villian enough of this already i hated this villian she should have had one fight with jason statham or vin diesel hand to hand.

the story is about dom going rogue to save his son & wife held hostage by cypher a tencho terrorist who wants to start world war 3 .

its same old plot done here in new style.i am not impressed ive seen this in james bond films & mission impossible many times.

and cypher killed elena plus she escapes from the plane easily.whole film goes down the toilet.

i love & respect vin diesel but he lost it here.",3
The Fate of the Furious,It was very worst fast and furious movie I see. I love Paul walker init,3
The Fate of the Furious,The only reason to watch any of these movies is for the action sequences. Most of the acting is laughable at best. They should have stopped. The plots are getting more and more ridiculous and stupid.,3
The Fate of the Furious,"The first edition was clean, simple and appealing, 2nd and 3rd were close and then all hell broke loose. The idea of king of the streets with fast cars and a side story is so cool, why did they kill that?",3
The Fate of the Furious,The story was too bad and good enough like the previous part's,3
The Fate of the Furious,"As said by the title, I think so far this is the worst movie in the series, for one, it's unrealistic, how did shaw survive being shot up-close in a place that would kill him in the real world, how was Dom Torreto able to survive all the explosions in this movie, and was also stupid enough to listen to the horrible villian who's name I can't even remember, how did the drag racer in Cuba know exactly where dom was at the exact time he needed to be there, how was Torreto able to escape the pull force of 4 cars AND a military vehicle with only a GTX, and besides all that, the pacing is AWFUL, I wanted the movie to be over by the halfway point, so why didn't I give this a lower score? The comedy, I gotta say the movie is pretty funny but that still make up for what a bad movie that it is.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Completely pathetic and ridiculous, instead of entertaining, this movie is an authentic bore. If it's bad every time someone opens their mouth, it's almost as bad when it films action sequences in a way that almost nothing can be seen except when, countless times, it opts for slow motion. And some even call this ""good action""???

This franchise has long lost all sense and identity (well, they think the identity is saying ""family"" every 5 minutes). Fast Five was the last movie that cared even a little bit about looking like a film. This is now a set of absurdly ridiculous numbers - increasingly so because it has the obligation to always be bigger - followed by others, glued together with cheap sentimentality and olive oil that sticks to our bodies like a parasite. And bad dialogue. And bad acting. And zero logic (I'm not even talking about the absurd scenes, but the plot itself).

There are characters here who only serve as cheerleaders, others serve only for sexist jokes (some to make the jokes, some to be the target), and then there are those who take themselves too seriously, like Vin Diesel who really believes he's doing something with dramatic impact. The positive? Some - fewer and fewer - laughs and the fun introductory scene in Havana (proof that this could be absurd and simultaneously entertaining).",3
The Fate of the Furious,"To be human is to be curious, challenged, inspired, surprised. With that thought in mind if I see another car crashing street chase scene; guys with personal trainers with their haute couture designed tight T's and no sleeves; fakey robotic acting; all to pander to the narcissistic, then praise to God for the gift of FF. What a zzzzzzz waste of time; I would rather eat stale white bread for a year than endure those two hours of sameness. Well, on the positive side; guess who made a s load of money?",3
The Fate of the Furious,"The acting was bad, the script was even worse. The CG at the end of the movie was also horrible. They tried to CG a location only for it to turn out really bad. The Action was good, but most of it was highly unrealistic. How can someone's acting be so good in one movie (Kurt Russel in Deepwater Horizon) and really bad in others (this one)? It must be the director!",3
The Fate of the Furious,"So, the eighth part of one franchise, that in itself may not be good, but each subsequent sequel has more and more unbelieveble scenes. I don't think so in a good way. I almost got an eye infection the number of times I rolled my eyes. Some will say that tastes are not discussed, but it is really not clear to me what is special about films like this. One of the most expensive stupid movies in history, but also with huge profits. The math is clear, as long as the movies make big money, and this franchise makes billions, hey BILLIONS, dollars, the sequels will be made.

As for the plot, this reminds me a lot of Mexican soap operas, and not the quality ones, which have a lot of episodes, so then literally everything happens. A new family connection is revealed, a lost family, a found family, the characters die, the characters come back from the dead, the sides change, new things have to be constantly invented. I'm just waiting to find out that Dom is his own mother. And they could easily get to that if they record 3-4 more sequels.

Absolutely everything in the film is bad, the characters are funny but not in a positive way, the plot is almost irrelevant, the dialogues are a real cringe festival, and I watched more realistic action scenes in various children's cartoons where the laws of physics we know don't apply. The character played by Tyrese Gibson has only one task, in the whole film (actually in the whole franchise) he speaks stupid sentences from which I turned my head in disapproval. At one point, I became embarrassed at how bad it was. Even the attempts at humor (failed of course) are at such a low level that I couldn't always register them, something like how you can't hear sounds below a certain frequency. You can also play on this movie, take a sip of some booze when something extremely stupid happens. Spoiler alert - you will be dead drunk.

In the end, I came to one conclusion. This is actually a very expensive porn. There are a million sequels, the story is irrelevant, the dialogues are too bad and the action is overemphasized, lasts too long, is not even close to reality and the character always succeeds in his intention no matter how impossible.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Where did they film the sequence of the guys popping up with Gatling guns from the roof of a limousine to fire on street traffic? Was it Atlanta or Cleveland? Did the locals think that there was anything odd about that? How about when it started raining cars onto the sparse traffic below? I know this series likes its practical effects, feeling that, as in other entries, having cars come out of a plane's cargo bay at 30,000 feet cannot be believably done in CGI. I agree. There are lots of things you can say that of. Mutilating your own genitals, say, or swallowing a live cobra. I'm sure you can add to the list. Don't feel you have to on my account. Or think that any of it makes for a good movie.

The fiscal success of this franchise means they can hire an ever-expanded cast of solid and even excellent performers. Helen Mirren appears in a nice role here, although she does not appear on the cast list. I imagine that was her choice.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Generally I do not review movies, beyond just a star rating. However, this movie has a decent Star Rating. At the time of this review a 7.3. Unfortunately the reviews seem to be of the ""either its a 10 or a 1 variety"". Granted this movie makes me want to select 1 and leave it at that. However, the fake reviews granting this film anything above a 5- 6 pushed me to write it up.

The movie begins with over the top humor based on racial stereotyping. Because you know, middle class white kids get scarred when they see Polynesian themed dancing at grade school soccer games. Yet the wives of said kids all want the lead dancer...Please. This is not a serious action movie. By definition it's a Surreal Comedy (""A form of humor based on bizarre juxtapositions, absurd situations, and nonsense logic"")

Now ask yourself if this is the type of movie you signed on for. If yes, then have at it. Just remember, when you see a car doing highway speeds in reverse, that's an ""absurd situation""...laugh now. When race is used to shame your kids...laugh now. When every piece of technology used in the movie does not function properly or is used incorrectly during scenes, that's ""nonsense logic""...laugh now.

Personally, I expected a serious movie. Over the top car scenes would have been par for the course. But they need a decent story, and some realism to pull together an action movie worth watching. This movie has none of it. Well perhaps the props and special effects, and actors to interact with them.

Now while a 1 was what I wanted to give the film. The 3 represents the effort I saw from the actors, along with the special effects. When cars fly through the air...it looks like they are flying through the air, and the actors responds to the ridiculousness appropriately. Hence the 3.

Huge disappointment because I did not hate the previous installments, and I could have used a decent action/adventure movie for a distraction. This was so bad, everyone involved should be ashamed. That goes for the bull***t reviews and ratings which artificially elevated this movie's rating above a 5 or 6.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"I'm no professional movie reviewer - but I know a good movie when I watch one. This: not it. Not a good movie and if you're going to watch it for the same thrills and skills that the 1st 2nd and 3rd movie had, then you're going to have a bad time. It's not about cars and pink slips anymore, it's about Hollywood action and America-saves-the-world again. Avoid if you want a movie that resembles the theme of the first few. Watch till your heart's content if you love a cheesy action flick.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"fancy cars, road races, silly car chases, silly explosions. We've seen it all before. There's nothing new here. The best part of the movie is the opening, and that's it. About the acting, only Jason Statham, Helen Mirren and Kristofer Hivju live up to par. All in all, the movie is a go-see if you're a 12 year old or less.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"The theme of this movie is as you guessed ""family"", after seven iterations it gets boring.

This time the title fight is between a car and submarine with nuclear missiles, what are they going to do next car vs international space station or solar system.

All in all this movie sucks",3
The Fate of the Furious,"The original movie core was the tuning world. Focusing on races, on street tuning culture. Since Vin Diesel took the producing of the movie he focused only on the explosions and forgot to keep digging in a culture very rich itself with lot of stories to be told. Jason Statham switch to be good, Luke Evans, Toreto son's ... all messed up to complete a popcorn movie. Wish they stop filling the pockets and start thinking to come back to the origins.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"OMG. What kind of mess is this? If you see today the first F&F, was about friendship, family and racing. A lot in common with ""point break"", and it all made some sense with great cars, women and fun. Diesel not seemed so much interested in follow up until the nr 4 came along, and got the original cast together, with some new faces.

When the plot became less realistic, there was still a ""fun"" factor in it and the chemistry of Paul Walker, against the coolness of Vin. But every movie charm became less,action more important, even if the action would make no sense. Nothing wrong with action, but nothing was credible any more, and from the 6 it really became really brainless.

Of course I miss Walker in this. But even his presence would not have changed the fact the story made no sense at all. Ennemies from yesterday, who killed team mates, blow up a hospital, killed innocent people, become the savior of your child and your best buddy. Nuclear codes are given away, cars start to drive by themselves, and all is so unbelievable, that it takes away all your interest. What do you care what is happening when everything that is happening seems impossible? Why not add living dead or something more spectacular, all for the glory of unrealistic action. Wait, I can like that, in a Van Damme movie, but this was originally a movie about roque street-racers.

When you make a story, when nothing is believable, even kids will turn away. A hero is NOT in danger, if he survives the most unbelievable situations and so take away the suspense. You can make action and fun that is a bit more believable. That made the originally Bourne movies stand out.

Replacing Paul Walker, by Eastwood's boy, could have been a good idea, if even this poor guy could act. Gone Walker's smile and humor, but instead a tense actor, who seems to have a carrot in his ass. His nice blue eyes not save his performance.

Nothing against action, some exaggeration, but some logical, where you can care for the heroes. No, it is more a ""soap opera"", then a thrilling movie. The future not looks very bright.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"You know, the team behind Dominic Toretto had a lot of ""last rides"", so instead of chasing others, the team gets a reason to chase one of their own guys. The good guy turns bad (temporarily) and the bad guy suddenly becomes the new ""brother""...never seen that before.

After watching the trailer you can predict the whole story of the film and with a chance of 99% you will get it right. Apart from the normal smaller errors like self-repairing cars, the film suffers from major logical errors that are even visible for our ""smart guy"" Roman. Submarines at the speed of cars, never landing, refilling and invisible planes. Oh, and why should you shoot the bad guys in their cars with a bloody tank if you can also wait for Dom to appear in his tuned car ramming them? Seems legit. I could go on for ages but I'm getting tired.

The film might not be too bad for new viewers who just want some senseless action and a bit of fun. I did laugh for example during the Jason Statham ""plane-baby scene"", but that didn't fit to F&F at all. And by the way: Did they just trusted and worked together with a guy who killed Han and nearly the whole ""family"".

For any ""true"" Fast & Furious fans the franchise died when Paul did I guess. All following films are just plainly focused on getting the most money out of new and dumb-entertainment searching cinema visitors. Good luck then, I'm out Universal.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Just a good fun movie, a guilty pleasure, I'd give it 7 stars except for the hitchhikers of the franchise.

Tyrese and Ludacris are the worst actors in the business, and are clearly only getting work because Vin is loyal to his friends. Their delivery is stilted, poor and like a struggling actors audition tape.

The screenplay is clearly tweaked to throw them some token lines and screen time, but every time it does, it distracts from the movie and is a blatant attempt to throw some work their way. The rap game clearly isn't paying the bills.

Dwayne Johnson was smart to ditch this movie, and I don't blame him for avoiding any professional association with these plebs.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Entertaining Yes.

(Spoiler) Not real, Cuba Race, the Reverse Gear on Vehicles is low RPM (low speed) high Torque. Dom going into reverse and winning race is not possible, rear transaxle would have locked up.

(Spoiler) Berlin chase scene, Polizei Radios go faster than any vehicle.

(Spoiler) Not believable Cypher and Dom break into a National Security Facility, that normally has Layers of Sensors (including unhackable analogue), Lots of Guards.

(Spoiler) Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP) would have disabled Dom's Vehicle (Burnt out Wiring, Fuses, Battery, Transceivers (Communications), etc.); Russian Submarine on Land (Underwater the Submarine might survive) would not have anything electrical working, would require somebody to physically change electrical fuses, reset circuit breakers.

(Spoiler) Ramsey attacked by UNARMED ""Separatists"" not likely they would have just shot Ramsey in the head a couple of times.

(Spoiler) Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP) would have burnt out the electric winches to lower Russian Submarine into water.

(Spoiler) Russian Attack Submarine Alpha Class do not have Vertically Launched Nuclear Missiles.

(Spoiler) M-16 used by Rhodes as a Long Range Sniper Rifle, not likely.

(Spoiler) Russian Submarines did not, do not use ""torpedoes' with propellers and use Underwater Guided Missiles as Torpedoes, the VA-111.

(Spoiler) Even the fastest Russian Attack Submarine cannot outrun land vehicles. Anybody ever heard of tires to drive on ice for a Lamborghini? (Spoiler) Russian Alpha Class Attack Submarines are Nuclear Reactor Powered, there would not be a huge explosion and fire (No Petroleum Fire). If the Electro Magnetic Pulse destroyed the Electronics of the Submarine, then the electric pumps would not be pumping coolant into the reactor, there would be a nuclear reactor ""Meltdown"", then hydrogen gas explosion.

Franchise needs smarter Technical Advisors.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Some scenes were so badly acted and spiked with bad cgi that I felt like watching a c-movie. This is the worst movie of this series so far. I still feel bad that I even kept watching this **** after the first 3 movies. A true disgrace what the producers are doing here. At least they made a nice ad for coke, jeep etc. I'm wondering what they have to pay Charlize Theron for her to even consider starring in this huge load of *insert random negative word here*.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Although I am a big fan of the originals it seems there is no end to Hollywood's addiction to cheap and lucrative. This film boasts a great cast with action filled awesomeness. The end result is far from awesome in my opinion. You don't need to be an astrophysicist to spot the gaping flaws in the physics/reality of the film. I appreciate this is a movie but 80s sci-fi movies make a better attempt at sticking to reality than this does and for most people, especially car enthusiasts this will not please.

I recall the original films being focused around cars. Now I would say they focus as getting as many high paid action actors as possible throw them into a bad plot and a few fancy cars in there.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Action scenes are as bad as those found in bad Bollywood movies. 2 words that escape this movie; physics and logic, even in the first 10 minutes. Jumping off of your speeding car onto asphalt road, and not even a scratch ? Seriously ? Cheesy dialogs by Dom, oh my God ! Dom's verbal responses made me want to exit the theater. This is supposed to be street racer, but somehow along the franchise it turned into super spy more awesome than James Bond.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"Possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen & I loved every unbelievable terrible moment of this film.

Going into a movie there is always some suspension of disbelief, but this took it to a whole new level. You really shouldn't expect anything else after watching the other movies in this series.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"I don't understand all those 10 star reviews. They *must* be paid.

I watched this on Netflix and am I glad I didn't pay to see it in a theatre.

The F&F movies have always had a cavalier attitude toward physics and reality, but this one made my eyes bleed.

I am glad I was able to fast-forward, after my wife quit watching it with me half-way through.

The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 is because of The Rock and Jason Statham. Even though the scene on the plane with Mr. Statham was so bad, I had to fast-forward through it too.",3
The Fate of the Furious,"As a fan of the series you know and expect things to be rather over-the-top. But who cares, the series is about turning the brain off and watching the action. But there really is a limit to how obsurd things can get. From undetectable software the sweeps the whole internet every 6 seconds, a person ""off grid"" flying in a massive plane, the fastest car in Cuba out accelerated by the slowest car when the latter is in reverse. However nothing beats a single person controlling 100s of cars independently from a single computer. I really could go on for ages. This film has a wonderful cast and one can only thing they must have paid very well to over look the plot. Shame they didn't have the money to pay someone with high school science to explain a few of the issues. Yes the action is great as ever but this really can never be more than background TV because you really do not want to follow the plot.",4
The Fate of the Furious,Not as much street racing as the originals which is disappointing,4
The Fate of the Furious,"I think someone is holding all the actors babies hostage...forcing them to be in this movie.

Even the editing was laughable.

I guess nobody associated with the movie researched how computers and electronics work. How EMP's work, submarines work, or how ice or gravity works.

I couldn't give this less then 4, because I've seen most the actors in even worse movies.

Just mute the movie, put on some music you like, and watch the stunts.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"About everyone at once movies it is more and more boring, at the same time it is more and more action. And the most important - already so fragmentary cliche that there is no wish to watch the movie already on the middle, and you watches a plot purely by inertia further. And history with the Russian military base and the submarine is the dumbest stereotype about Russians.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"How and why Charlize Theron signed on to this Furious garbage is beyond me. This circus retains its predecessors' worst feats & dumbs its audience further, with new idiotic annoyances that exasperates. Here, Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson & Ludacris' meta human & super genius fantasies remains its laughable entertainment trademark. Its overused slander of family bonds that inspires memes over affection, remains its emotional sham. It as well continues to parade the cheesiest of monologues that is cringeworthy at its best. With these inconveniences in tow, it is then sarcastically amazing how the franchise found ways to succumb to new lows and worsts. For instance, this recent drop foregoes efforts to give its antagonists interesting motivations. It as well embraces its ludicrous propensity to turn past villains, into heroes at a random. It even over explains its characters misplaced ingenuity, discrediting its audience's ableness to see through the fiasco. Worst, its storyline is a mishmash of the most generic of action movie tropes.

It is then worthy to surmise that F Gary Gray & Chris Morgan, have abandoned efforts to render a Fast & Furious movie that has a worthy story or at least a logical one, by any measure. Thank goodness for torrents, as by no means will I spend my hard earned moolah for this exhausting crap.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"All in all this is a good action movie with plenty of jokes . But is this fast and furious ? Definitely NO . The movie starts from being about street racers with believable crime to a group of past street racers fighting criminal gangs .

But fast 8 makes even mutant looks weak . Cars flying around , superhuman powers kinda level which leaves drivers feels nothing from car crashes .

The worst part is , the story line is not even believable . Even if they are legendary car racers , how come the gang are more powerful and skilled in weaponry than CIA , FBI , OR Army of any country. Fast 8 makes james bond weak .

This is not about car race action anymore . Sad for what it becomes .",4
The Fate of the Furious,I am not a smart guy but even I caught myself saying that couldn't happen 100 times during this movie. My girlfriend is a fan of this series and I have sat through a few of them but this one found me checking my phone very often. The cast is great but the words they are saying sounds like a frat president wrote the script. That being said if you feel like watching pretty women and nice cars its worth a watch just assume it is a fantasy.,4
The Fate of the Furious,"In the opening of the movie Tropical Thunder, there is a fake trailer showing Ben Stiller as a tough action hero defending himself against the end of the world. By the 6th sequel he's defending his baby against the end of the world. Meanwhile we are at the 8th installment of the F&F series with no end in sight. So, yes we are left with Vin Diesel, tough action hero, defending his baby against the evil villain.

We can list all of the tropes required now. Many shots of female backsides. Wildly over-the-top unrealistic caper that takes place with cars. Tough guy one upmanship. More car stunts that resemble toys flying around with no sense of danger. The barbecue party at the end. This franchise thought to ""up the ante"" by hiring more action film stars, The Rock and Jason Stathom. And then added to it's cool factor by hiring Kurt Russell.

The film requires more punches than words of dialogue. Frankly, these movie stars need to little more than pose in front of the camera for a day's work. As much as Vin Diesel talks about family and what's right blah blah blah, it really restricts his two dimensional character, because he isn't allowed to be or do anything that isn't 100% cool. Same with Rock and Stathom, they really are cartoon characters that exist only to fight and chase things.

This movie fails because the villain is pretty boring. It matters little what the mcguffin is. A good number of the action scenes want to seem 'legit', using real cars and real stunts. But then they all transition to CGI as the action scene becomes goofy. In this case, there is the idea of hacking into cars that have the latest ""autodrive"" feature. Of course in 2017 there are only 2 or 3 models out there that have this feature, but in this movie they can hack any model and remotely drive them. It makes for some ok CGI candy seeing an army of robot cars but is totally bereft of reality.

Charlize Theron has established herself as an action oriented actress, but still is only as good as the material and the director. She is dangerous in Mad Max 4, but here she almost seems like she's going through the motions, despite the 'heavy' scenes she plays. As for the rest of the gang, they have always been there for the humour, but I doubt the screenwriter is known for his brilliant jokes.

I wonder how much audiences will continue to support this franchise as it becomes more comic book in tone and look. I suppose if the franchise continues to find new types of action scenes that involve cool cars. But looking at the diminishing numbers for the Transformers series, you would think a niche series like this would find it's limits.

I can't recommend this film, and still think Fast Five has the best elements of the series before going too over-the-top. Although the action scenes can be watchable, you know you're really looking at models and CGI (why after a couple decades of CGI can they still not create realistic looking flames?).",4
The Fate of the Furious,Watched Fate of the Furious last night. I wanted to like this movie. But you'll get no ringing endorsement from me. Just too much going on for me to settle into the plot. And when it did slow down it slowed to a turtle's pace so much so that I used the time as a bathroom break - no pause. Thin script filled with corny one liners. I'll pass on this one.,4
The Fate of the Furious,"I don't know how this movie is being rated 10/10 by some . The plot is rubbish , thought up by a 12 year old probably . Over the top action and they keep coming up with new ways to defy the laws of physics. The acting is well below par, stupid at times, made me cringe seeing good actors do stupid s**t.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"Unfortunately, this entry of the just goes way too off the mark and majorly ends up jumping the shark. The other films were still fun in their own ridiculous way but this one is just too much.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"Well I like the new movie but if we compare it with the older ones, they are way better.... I think we want more racing action than fighting with guns and just a small part with cars... The next Series of this movie ( Fast 9 ) I recommend it to be something more like Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift or 2 fast 2 Furious... Thanks!",4
The Fate of the Furious,"A true testament to Vin Diesels acting skills. The range of Vin's facial expressions shows how truly diverse his acting skills are. Right at the top of his game making watchers truly believe he is who he plays in the movie.

As for the rest of the actors, they did an amazing job too.

The movie was so realistic and intense I found it had to give it a 4/10. I really should have given it a 7/10 because it was that good.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"It was a very big embarrassment with the missing character of MIA and her baby in the film, the movie was beyond expectation but when i saw the movie it was really shocking that the continuous character of MIA has been suddenly wiped out, Overall the movie was very good with some good comic sequences and i really wanted to give a good rating but due to the missing character of MIA and the new born baby of brian aka paul walker in fast 7 made me give a low rated movie",4
The Fate of the Furious,"The Fate of the Furious is the eighth movie in franchise. And I expected more. More I don't know. For me Fast and Furious ""in one harness"" with Pirates of the Caribbean. Yes, I understand, that they very different, but both have such atmosphere of adventure and action So, I like them all. When many observers said that Pirates are the bottom of the franchise, but new Fast is superb, I was delighted. I liked the last Pirates, so Fast should be excellent! But you read the heading and must understand – that's not true.

(this review contains spoilers!!!)

Citius, Altius, Fortius! (Olympic motto)

Main problem pf the movie – it is boring. Really, don't understand. In the movie from which you expect action, action and only action this action is not interesting. Paradoxically. There are several interesting moments, for example race in the beginning, some moments on the Russian military base.

But all this flow of action flashes before eyes. And you are getting bored. Creators tried to put in movie more and more action, that it became a problem.

Old, old Diesel and his frenemy

For me Diesel is an actor of one role. He played himself. Man of the rock. But deep inside, he is very empathic. This is problem for many actors, that ""find"" their best roles and then play only them. But in Fast 8 you understand, how did Diesel got older. How old is he? Okay, wiki 50! Sometimes camera was shooting him from different angles and you see this. Fast 8 shows, that a few more films and Diesel must change his ""emploi"" on scene. But he is good now. And he is first of the two reasons to watch movie.

Second reason is Jason Statham. He is a bright spot on this film.

Other comrades of Diesel can be characterized as The ROCK! I'm sorry, Dwayne Johnson, two Afro-Americans, smart girl, always dissatisfied Michelle Rodriguez and Kurt Russel's guy. That's all, what's left after ""10 friends of Diesel"" from previous parts.

Character of Dwayne Johnson turned out to be uninteresting in this part. Agree, if the dancing of Maori's haka with thirteen-year girls was only interesting moment for Hobbs, that means something.

Main villain (or Charlize Theron) was interesting character, but only on the beginning. Charming and incomprehensible she ceased to be after several scenes with her. This is problem of the script, not Charlize. When villain only sitting indoors with computers and saying strange things - it is bad. Bad for image of villain. And her assistant - Kristofer Hivju (that red-beard guy from Game of the thrones). I understand that you can make terrible face. For a script you are nothing.

Script, script, script

This time writers decided to be original. Trailer told us, that Diesel is turning to evil. But in fact, all this is more prosaic. Yes, Diesel is forced to be evil. But because his son and some woman were captured by Charlize Theron. I didn't re-watch all 7 films, so really, who is this woman? And why nobody didn't know about his son? It's like ""Dom, where are you going?"" ""I'm going for carrot. Will be late!"" Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) – his beloved – didn't know anything? But main villain knew!

And main question – why does she need Diesel? Does she have no money to pay for good specialists? But she have own plane with group of special forces. So, she have money. She sent Diesel himself on different tasks (important tasks). If he fails, the operation failed. What motivated the villain to such behavior? Because we need a conflict. And we need Diesel. So, script is simple with some rudiments of intrigue.

What are good in movie – that are shooting and cars. Scene on the Russian military base in the winter – beautiful.

But as a result, the whole movie is boring. 4/10",4
The Fate of the Furious,I adore this series but this was desperate and cringy. Time for the franchise to rest.,4
The Fate of the Furious,"🎶Been Spending most our lives, livin in a plot-hole Paradise!🎶",4
The Fate of the Furious,"I enjoy Vin Diesel the least in this cast, so the whole soap opera with him in this installment felt tedious and boring throughout. Charlize Theron has the most pretentious and vague dialog, that is supposed to sound super cool but only succeeds at reminding you of The Matrix sequels. The action scenes, while great conceptually, are missing something in execution that the last few achieved. Also half of the cast feels unnecessarily crammed in for this plot. I'm ready for Justin Lin to return to this franchise, he knew how to construct the different set pieces to maximum effect and give everyone in the crew something to do.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"I always liked the outrageously impossible action scenes in the Fast & Furious series, packed with nice visuals and entertaining music. So when this film came out I was naturally eager to see it. The big issue? This movie introduces a series of goofy Jar Jar Binks characters that just absolutely destroy the movie in my opinion. That discussion between the poorly dressed government agent and the Rock on the side of the girls football pitch? Lame. That new agent recruit who does everything wrong? Lame lame lame. Couldn't even finish the movie because of all this lameness.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"I've been binging all the FF movies and I got to say this is by far the worst of the bunch.

These movies are just stupid and ridiculous and should never be taken seriously, yet this movie seems to mess up the formula. The ridiculous is a bit too ridiculous. The comedy doesn't properly land. The movie tries to be darker and it just doesn't fit. The villain's plan just makes no sense, it's incredibly lame and completely breaks the immersion.

Vin Diesel turns into the Winter Soldier for whatever reason. The NYC sequence is detestable.

Even in a movie where logic is out the window, betraying the basic premises you set up at the beginning of the movie is just dumb. They wanted to find a way for Dom to be the Winter Soldier, but couldn't make it work, so they did it anyway, and it doesn't work.

Excessive use of god level hacking ruins pretty much every scene. When you can do stuff such as controlling hundreds of cars of all brand and time at the same time from one laptop, or remotely control a soviet era submarine with nuclear rockets, then what is it that you can't do? You got no limits excepts when the plot puts those limits on you. And what's up with these generic enemies spawning into every scene out of nowhere? And the random kiss for only shock value? Nothing works in this movie.

Not as fun not thrilling as the past ones.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"Poor story and very, but very bad dialogues. As a car lover and also a fan of the series, the moment I saw a Lada Niva chasing super cars was the movie killer for me. Other than that 90% of the car scenes / chases were unrealistic. If you like cars and racing, then these is not the movie for you!! However if you can accept that a piece of crap car can drive in reverse, with 200 km/h with the engine on fire and win a race ... then go watch it. I thing I've had to big expectations from this movie.. I see it like a parody to the franchise.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"-It looks like they are trying to make as much as money they can get out of the franchise, well i want my money back, i guess that i have never been this bored while watching a movie, let's start with the plot a very weak and also cliché which you can figure out only from watching the trailer, literally almost every scene was a cliché scene i kept face palming myself all the time.

-""keep the audience suspended while he betrays his family for who knows what reason""

-one of the most expected things ""they got someone he care about to blackmail him at the same time someone that fans really can't even remember so they can kill her""

-""Let's kill the girl he loved and let him have the baby to live with the girl he loves"" yeah like who could expect that.

-""Let's make the bad guy from the previous movie help him to get the new bad guy"" really ??? he tried to kill you all the time and he killed Han for crying out loud.

-something kept bugging me how the hell Brian (Paul Walker) didn't see that freaking time square turned into a war zone.

-The acting is so weak at all especially Michelle Rodriguez and of course Vin Diesel is the same like every movie couple shouts and screams hit that and hit this,the Rock aka ""Hulk"" crashing everything like he got super powers, broke iron cuffs hit a government employee and guards just stand watching in a ridiculous scene also the prison scene which was the worst in the movie.

-The action scene made me feel like science fiction movie super hero guys no bullets get them they don't bleed, the cars never run out of gas and can drive heavy vehicles on ice and one of them can kick a freaking torpedo but to be honest this was for the hole franchise but they took it to a new level in this one.

-To sum up i gave 4 out of 10 for the couple laughs that i have had during the movie and effort they made in smashing and destroying all these cars which was kinda pointless but still was nice effort, but wasn't worth the money i paid for ticket and time that i wasted i hoped for better.",4
The Fate of the Furious,"I give this a four, but my companion doubled that as he loved it. If you like furious car action with a few drips of soppy-ness, some humor and lots of crazy action this picture is for you. This film is one in a series and the current episode sees our lead hero apparently double crossing his colleagues.... The acting is wooden and hammy, the story is ludicrous but who cares and there is a big market for those who are into junk food for the brain!",4
The Fate of the Furious,"This film feels like it's channeling more Roland Emmerich energy than ever before, and it's worse (or better?) for it. After a mostly grounded beginning, the series jumps the megalodon (the shark was leapt over in the fourth film) with its big action sequence in the middle. My brain shut off halfway through and it's still in the process of rebooting. I was talking about the directors, and the craftsmanship in the previous film's reviews. Not here. I don't really care as much anymore. Too much car fumes make brain go bye bye.

I don't know how they keep getting away with this.

Still, more entertaining than the fourth one though.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"It has been a decade since this movie came out and I did not realize how terrible the movie was when I first watched this as a kid, To be honest, I used to have fun memories watching this movie when I idiot with no taste and being too naive around the time believing that it was a good movie. Which made me realize that I was baited believing it was a good movie now that I watched this movie again trying to refresh my memory after hearing bad things about Micheal bay transformers movies so I decided to 4 transformers that were on Netflix re-watching them to refresh my memory also to see for myself if there are bad before judging. So far, I could easily say the 4th one was the worst. It felt soulless. This was not a movie but rather a commercial for China, and as a kid, I did not realize it because I was a dumb kid! I enjoyed the first Transformers movie. I thought it was good, but the 4th movie is where it got worse and it lost the integrity that Micheal Bay had with the first one. I felt bored and also felt completely empty inside of me. What I mean by that is I felt cold and soulless; I got nothing even at the end of the movie.

Now what are the things I liked about this movie to be honest not a lot of things I thought the acting of the main character ""Mark Wahlberg"" was okay even if the main character was bland and one-dimensional and I thought the other characters acting including the villains was not bad and I thought ""Joshua joyce"" played by Stanley Tucci was funny at one part of the movie that's all positives I give to this movie but I don't care about them the film focuses on them way too much something that is in a Transformers Movie they should not be the main focus. This movie literally felt like the same thing again as the first movie for the 3rd time. It's not exciting anymore. We want something different, but this is the opposite of trying to improve it. So overall, this movie was worse than I remember watching it as a kid, and it made me upset because I wanted to like this movie; I really love movies. I want to like it, but I have to accept the fact this movie is a commercial, but this movie is not as horrible as Spy Kids 4, I hope that it won't get worse with the 5th movie.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"These films are like narcotics. They're so bad for you, but as you sit there watching, you get strangely complacent about their bad qualities. You get pulled into the explosions, the gadgetry, the action scenes, the obnoxious cheesiness of it. Only later do you realize that you're basically causing the tumour to grow larger and filthier with the hard-earned coin you're sacrificing to feed Michael Bay.

Sure, it's a great-looking film. The special effects are topnotch, the action scenes feel suitably heavy and there are multitude of them. The budget shows, that's for certain. Furthermore, Mark Wahlberg, as bland and boring as his character is, still remains a definite improvement over Shia LaBeouf.

It's the everything else that doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that it's scraping the very bottom of the barrel. The story is the exact same as it has always been. Superficial skin changes have been made to fool the feeble-minded, but it's the exact same story of some big bad corporation guy working for Decepticons, which are in turn fought by the Autobots aided by some random schmuck.

What's worse, even the action is starting to become repetitive. There are certain slow motion scenes that are exact ripoffs from the previous films. The score is still entirely forgettable, the characters are cardboard cutouts, the plot makes little sense whatsoever and even the intrinsic coolness of battle robots duking it out is not as exciting as it was three movies ago. No, not even the dino robots.

I regret seeing this film. I regret allowing Michael Bay to continue making these films. I was weak, my friends were going as well, but that's no excuse. I have to stop this, and I urge you to do the same.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I don't need to see this movie to know exactly what happens. Allow me to guess- Are there talking robots? Do the talking robots fight? Are there product placements made in this movie specifically for the lucrative Asian movie going audience? Will there be a video game made with the same name as this movie? Does a supporting character die, or almost die? If that supporting character is a talking robot, does that talking robot appear dramatically towards the end, like you thought he was dead but then it turns out he isn't and you know it's a he cause movies like these don't have any roles for women except role of dead eyed super model- Does this movie have a dead-eyed super model cast as the love interest? Asking questions is how we learn things!",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This movie is nothing but anti-western communist propaganda, the cold war never ended and those that convinced us it did are guilty of the ultimate betrayal and according to the UN's definitions, genocide. From the opening of this movie it's filled with negative and destructive propaganda, the introduction of walburgs daughter is telling, she and her friends want to ""get a tan and get wasted"" tanning is destructive to the skin, unhealthy, increasing aging to the skin and it's downright xenophilic for anyone with light skin to want darker skin and obviously getting wasted is very destructive to the individual and the family as well, they portray her father as an antiquated oaf who thinks her slutty clothing is inappropriate while they portray her as a mature and responsible person, they even spell it right out for the really dumb people in a conversation early on where she says shes more mature than he is. The makers of this movie know that children are watching transformers, it's not an R rated film, they know exactly what they're doing to condition children. The ""minorities"" in this film are also comically stereotypical. They've managed to turn a benign children's cartoon series into a metaphor for the mass immigration of western society but portray anyone against the mass immigration as being evil, phobic and regressive. Communists have controlled the media for over 100 years and most of these communists are members of a single ethnic group that is not native to the areas they disproportionately rule over, this makes their actions outright genocide.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I beg of you Michael Bay never make a movie again. This is my first review ever, but the movie is so bad i couldn't help it, probably the director wanted to recreate the transformers cartoon series that was awful from my point of view. He managed to steal 3 hours of my life with cheesy lines and all the known human clichés sprinkled around by a blind man and they felt wherever the gravity was stronger, and there isn't an intelligent situation or conversation in all the movie, so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE never make a transformers movie again or any movie for that matter.this is all i had to say but since i'm obliged to write 10 lines of text so the review will get through ill continue writhing nonsense much like the whole movie.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Just that, worst Transformers movie ever, couldn't even finished the sh&t..

It is so stupid long I couldn't even get the half of the plot right.

The Transformers formula failed all the way by only using Mark and plain model as principal actors.

Michael Bay just r@pe the original story (which i grew up with) and make a blockbuster-sci-fi-drama-POS.

This movie proves again that great actors, lots of explosions and a great franchise will never be the recipe for a great movie.

Don't waste your money...",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This movie is a pile of crap what the deuce was Michael Bay thinking About when he was directed this pile of crap. I mean they kill half the Autobots they nearly kill Optimus. If I don't see some A Transformers movie worth watching real soon. I will not watch 5, or 6. And who was the moron who hired this pathetic including Mark Walhberg who sucks. I lost a little respect for Michael Bay. Because I'm at the point where I don't even wanna watch the next two movies. And the music in this movie is the worst of all 4 movies. So all you people who think amazing all you morons who think this movie is amazing....I this movie sucks monkey Heine!!!!! This movie is a disgrace to the Transformers franchise. And Galvatron is alright not the greatest in this movie. And how I made it through the whole pile of Michael Bay film is a mystery to me. So my final thoughts are this movie could have been a lot better.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This is not a movie! This is a collection of random shots. It's called a movie because it has all the technical aspects of a real movie. This is so so bad. As bad as Transformers 2 and 3. Or even worse! I got lost between all this awful movies. Michael Bay surpassed Ed Wood as the worst filmmaker in cinema history! Congratulations! Nothing makes sense here! There is no plot, no credible characthers, no nothing. But what worries me the most is that this movie was a huge success. What does this tell us about the audiences' intelligence, taste and demanding spirit? I love the idea of transformers but Bay massacred it! It needs an urgent reboot!",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I don't know what could the cast, producers, directors, and everyone else involved in this production could do worse. I think everything has been done to make this movie a total disaster!

What's up with two blonds with absolutely no storyline for either? Do we go back to the Hollywood period of putting some pretty faces with dumb dialog? Because in almost 3 hours of this movie neither one had a single substantial thing in their lines. Well, I can actually say the same of all the dialogs in this movie.

The plot of the movie is incredibly weak and has no substance to it. And characters are blah. It feels like several people just threw in pieces of their ideas without combining it into a single flow. I barely made it through the entire movie. What a waste of time and production money.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"The most surprising thing about this movie is that at this point (10/5/2014) it is rated 6.3! I have read through the reviews and very few gave this movie more than 3 stars. It was terrible! Hard to watch. Acting was awful! Must be some studio minions hyping this movie?!?

I am very surprised that anyone liked Marky Mark over Shia, it was not a good casting at all. Wahlberg was great in Lone survivor, Broken City, The Fighter, Invincible... but in this movie he was supposed to play a neurotic failed robot inventor and he floundered. It was extremely poor acting reminiscent of Pain and Gain, another failed attempt by Wahlberg at neuroses. The description says he is a mechanic, I was expecting Sparkplug: a dumb jock but loyal and hard working (where Wahlberg excels) but instead I am supposed to buy him as a sub-genius robotics inventor/ former football star? At least with Shia he played the neurotic role well. It is what Shia does well and what we expect from him. Wahlberg doesn't fit this role at all and clearly this was not written with him in mind.

Other than the poor casting and worse acting, this movie fails exactly where the newest Superman and the newest Thor movies did: no plot, overdone CGI, and seemingly invincible antagonists and protagonists. I hope Hollywood gets a clue that when you have two invincible enemies fighting and destroying whole cities or worlds it is not entertaining! Especially when one of them is killed in one swift sequence. The insurmountable odds concept only works with quick wits, and a great plot.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Incoherent mess of a movie where basically you are dumped from one robot fighting scene with no sense into another. There is no story line other than 4 people running among robots duking it out

Apparently targeting systems do not work (all rockets fired miss) Collateral damage to buildings seems to be the objective of each and every attack.

The filming itself is poor lots of shots that add nothing to the movie. A guy with the equivalent of a peashooter can take out a robot that moments before was taking a pounding from a rocketlauncher and shook it of.

Sorry this movie is a mess, not worth your money.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Not sure if this is much of a spoiler or it is just confirmation of what was already bad. This is just another transformers movie, with bad jokes, bad humor, racism, stereotypicalism (that means they use stereotypes to much). I was promised dinobots in the movie and didn't get them till the very end. The only redeeming quality I could see was that there was an autobot that could fly (for once other then Optimus Prime). Also there's a scientist thinking that one cyberforming location is enough to prove that all dinosaurs did not die from an asteroid. Wow, one instance of dinosaurs found turned into metal, why do you need more evidence to rethink your dinosaur death theory? So moving on, megatron comes back from the dead, again. Unfortunately by this time I had lost interest in the movie to such an extreme that I left because I didn't get what I wanted (dinobots).",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I really felt sorry that the good cast had their talents waisted on this terrible storyline. It was a never ending cliché throughout the movie and I had doubts about the characters (and the writers) intelligence on several occasions. .

I am also not a fan of the shaky cam style used throughout the show. When it's shaky and moving that fast I feel like important details get missed.

I also felt like this was a way to long commercial with explosions, bad script, and directing. We saw beats by Dre, Oreos, Samsung, Budweiser, gm cars, Goodyear, and that was just the ones off the top of my head. Each product placement scene was so terribly obvious it was painful.

I honestly wasn't even going to watch this movie since everyone I talked to said it was bad, but sadly I decided to watch it since my brother rented it. I honestly don't understand how Michel bay is getting work as a director.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Michael Bay needs to stop ruining our childhood.

The only thing this film did right, and I mean the ONLY thing, is they finally cleaned up the Transformer's animation so you can kinda actually see what's going on during a fight. That's it. Now the bad...

Question:

Who went to see the movie to watch Optimus Prime almost die... AGAIN? Nobody. Who went to see the movie to watch Optimus Prime start whining about his loosing faith in humanity... again? Nobody. Who went to see the movie to watch Optimus Prime pull a Zack Snyder and kill somebody? Nobody.

Who went to see this movie TO SEE THE DINOBOTS!!!?!!!

EVERYBODY! Everyone. Every - one.

Guess what? The Dinobots are in the movie for a painfully ineffective 12 minutes. The Dinobots are not named. Nope, not one; not even Grimlock. The Dinobots are wusses... One falls off a ledge into water and is out; another is flying, then suddenly stops and crashes into a building for no apparent reason; and Grimlock, oh yes the big tough leader, get's back-fisted in the face ONCE by a robot 1/3rd his size, dislocates his jaw, and passes out. ... Yeah.

None of them talk. None of them successfully do any severe damage. None of them show a relative imperviousness to pain or damage. NONE OF THEM ARE DINOBOTS!

Michael Bay should be sued for false advertising (or at least for making crappy films).

It's nothing short of a depressing waste of your time. (I got it for free in Redbox, and am still angry about my loss.)

Oh, and they invented Galvatron!!!! ...oh, but he doesn't matter at all and just kinda walks away. No really.

Horrific.

Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers Age of Extinction was truly the ugly step-sister among the Transformers series. Although the movie had amazing graphics, special effects, thrilling action scenes, and a terrific cast, it was all ruined by the overcomplicated plot of the story as well as the designs for some of the new transformers. The movie has multiple sub-plots and unnecessary scenes that drag the movie along for almost three hours.

One of the movies initial problems is the overcomplicated story line and multitude of subplots. Generally most movies have one major villain accompanied by a sidekick and a few minions; that's not the case for this movie. There are three different major villains in the movie, which each had to be defeated; before long it became quite redundant. This caused the length of the movie to seem almost infinite, I literally sat in the theatre praying the movie end; sparing me from further torture.

The worst thing about the movie by far was the design of the new transformers. We've all got a pretty basic understanding of how transformers work. They're giant metal alien robots who can transform into various vehicles. Essentially all the parts they use to transform are a part of that transformers body. That's no longer the case for this movie, the transformers are wearing clothing; for example one of them wears a jacket and the other a hat. It completely ruins the idea of Transformers. It doesn't end there; they really sealed the deal when they decided to give the robots accents. It's ridiculous; they are robotic aliens from Cybertron and they have Japanese and county accents. I'm confused are they interplanetary aliens or just illegal aliens? All in all Transformers Age of Extinction was an abomination. The movie was overcomplicated and way too long, and the new transformers were an utter disgrace. This movie isn't worthy of the name Transformers, it's like one of those off-brand items you see when you go to the store; it's more like Transmorphers.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"To be fair I quite enjoyed the 1 & 2 installments, the 3rd was sufficiently entertaining but this one is a complete mess. Being 165 minutes long, it must either have an extraordinary plot (I did not mind watching Schindler's List at all) or memorable moments, but this movie lacks both. Senseless plot with countless holes, stupid dialogs and the worst: robots that act and talk like some gangs you might see in the streets. I tried hard to concentrate but all I could think of was ""Tessa STOP screaming!"". Seriously, if Michael Bay could cut all humans in this movie and keep the actions alone, I would buy it. For the meantime: just no.",1
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"From the first 10 minutes of this films near 3 hour long running time, this has nothing but offered me a massive f*ck you to the face!

If you have an IQ of 160! Avoid this at any particular cost!",1

Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I re watched this film today, it was on Netflix and thought why not. Maybe I was in a bad mood when I first watched the film because I remember it was utter garbage when I saw it in the cinema.

And yeah it's still utter tripe... unless you are a toddler this film is about as entertaining as a wet kipper on a Wednesday afternoon.

The script is terrible. The 'humour' is soul destroying, the effects are good until you see the whole Mazda zoom zoom transforming in mid air nonsense... those effects are dreadful in comparison to every other CGI In the film so I'm not sure why they kept them in (other than not giving a damn).

And while I'm on that subject... are we suppose to believe that humans are able to roll out this tech and the transformers never were able to ?!?? Like REALLY?! Anyway I am lacking anymore will to write anymore.. just recalling this drivel has me pooped.

Ultimately this franchise has become a cash cow with this film in particular the lowest of the low. The popularity of the series Is fueling its own downfall. It seems to me that anyone Involved in the filmmaking of this poo feels no pressure to make an effort as the film will sell anyway. REBOOT PLEASE",1

Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Very disappointing. 1) Acting was sub-par at best. I remember back when Mark Wahlberg was first starting out as an actor. I forget the movie I first saw him in as the lead, but his acting was so bad I watched several people walk out in the first 15 minutes and then 10 minutes later, myself and who I was with couldn't take it any longer and had to leave. Why did I mention this, because just as I thought M.W. was improving, he showed how actors can revert back to when they first started out. His acting was almost that bad :( He's not fully to blame as the script for his part was so so.

2) What were the directors thinking?- In the movie they pair up M.W. with actress Nicola Peltz (she wasn't too bad at acting)as his daughter. What a mistake (there were plenty in this movie)! Had they made her his niece or cousin then the relationship would have been more believable, but portrayed as his daughter, it was ridicules (you will see right off the bat what I mean when you see this movie)

3)Come on directors; this is an example of extreme laziness! There is a scene after M.W. and N.P. get down off this spaceship into the city where some guy jumps out of his car- he (guy from the car) says something to M.W., M.W. replies (forget what they said) but then all of a sudden M.W. brings back his hand (his hand is not shown on the screen at this point) into view and he some hows has a beverage in his hand (beer, or some kind of beverage with a cap on it)! He takes the the beverage and opens it on door frame of the guys car and drinks it. The city has just been smashed some, they are in the middle of the street with traffic, the owner of the car is presumed to be a blue collar worker and not drunk nor drinking, and some how M.W. pulls a drink out of mid-air! That is proof the directors down play the intelligence of the audience.

This is a must see film ONLY due to the fact it is transformers, but that is the only reason. Don't pay to see it in the theaters and if you can get a friend to go halves or borrow a copy of it, then it might be worth the $2.00 dollars to waste your time on..MIGHT BE.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I like the other Transformer movies... but this was almost unwatchable.

How did they screw this up so much? Their are too many story lines running side by side (with little or no resolutions)... the editing is terrible, even the CG is bad.

The pre-title opening was nice... but then it got slow... and then slower, then the story started to jump around... the editing started to become patchy.. then the story and script just got completely tied in a knot... and somewhere along the way it turned into a bad SyFy Channel movie. (actually, I've seen better dialog and better scripts on SyFy movies)

The CG just kept getting worse as the movie progressed. Then it just... ends.

Save your money. Not even worth watching on TV, unless you are a real Mark Wahlberg fan. He managed to pull off a nice performance despite all the things done wrong in this film.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Wow, after the third episode my expectation wasn't that high, but this extreme low level of story and dialogs was really astonishing. Obversely the declared goal of Michael Bay was to set the lowest level of consciousness possible, so that even a chimpanzee may understand the story, because there is (almost) none. The only thing you see are uncoordinated sequences of CGI-orgies, accompanied by meaningless dialogs of the protagonists which obversely do anything for money... In the beginning there was so much story-potential in the transformers world, but now there is only a black hole - what a waste... In my case the cinema-audience commented the movie by cyclic collective forehead- clapping - a really rare behavior. The only stars are earned by the CGI people and the rendering-farm.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I went into the cinemas watching this movie with no expectations as I know movie franchises often get dull and boring after the second sequel and I was right, all the concepts covered were repetitive and not original.

The idea of making humans suddenly go against the Transformers with so much hatred after the Autobots single-handedly save them several years ago in Chicago, is absolutely joke. There is no back story of how the Decepticons and humans (some from the corrupted US Government, anyways) become allies just adds to the frustration of the movie.

They also went cheap with the transformations with many not shown on screen and most of the Decepticons transformation animated like liquid-water cubes being less complex and easier to pull off. Apparently they hired an offshore special effects company to do all the CGI as it was deemed cheaper. Disappointments left-right-and-centre from there. Michael Bay ought to be court-marhshalled for this...he also stuffed up the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remake too. They have made too many Transformers motion picture movies yet there is still two more installments left. Stop already, please.

If you go in watching this with no expectations then it is still mindless entertainment but overall, this movie is a joke...nothing compared to Part 1...not even close.

Cheers",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Its not much about Autobots VS Decepticons, its more about the people. Why? isn't it supposed to be about the transformers? this was almost like a war movie but with robots, boring really boring. MR Bay should retire if he keeps continuing doing crap like this: When are you gonna do a transformer movie and one with a decent story? Are you really proud over this? or are you just laughing all the way to the bank? the Voice overs where terrible, don't hire those guys again, and why this extremely boring sense of humor your trying to sneak in these movies? its not funny, learn for god sake.

This time you hardly got to know who was fighting ( which autobots ) against who. Only one doing a decent job was Kelsey Grammar, but not even he could lift this pile of crap.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Micheal Bay has obviously lost his ""The Rock"" touch, giving us piles of dog pooh for breakfast like Revenge of the Fallen and Armageddon. But what made this any different. Well, more. A lot MORE! And its 3 hour runtime doesn't help. The main thing wrong was the little things that he overlooked like the toned-out acting, the rehashed moments from District 9 and the things that flat-out made no sense, like that Transformer alien gun that was made in perfectly human size, and also trying to trick us into thinking it was a sword. And I'm not even going to mention the exhausting and stupid Michael Bay humour. I'll sum it up like this: If you took your girlfriend to see this movie, she would break up with you, and it won't be the action-movies-clichés' fault. THE worst movie of the year, period.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"It's a 165 minute bone crushing juggernaut of a BALL BUSTING HEADACHE! If you look up the word OVERKILL in the dictionary this movie will appear and RAPE you with FX and AUDIO and not stop! When you think it might be over it's not EVEN CLOSE -- It's SOFA-KING LONG! And awhile later when you think ""HEY It's GOT to be wrapping up now"" NOT EVEN! Sequence after sequence of the SAME SHEEIT! The same YELLING! And they just HAVE to CAST EVERYBODY in it too and they just HAVE to stay relentless with the non stop clichés. I could go on but I can't go on because I have a serious FRICKING HEADACHE! WTF!? Give me a FRICKEN break. Give it a 2 because the opening in the barn was great!",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I loved the series up until now. I was very excited to watch this installment and was extremely disappointed. I will simply try to forget this one exists.

Odd to say that it lacked realism but it did. Of course it's a fantasy movie but all movie was a bunch of explosions and forced humour with characters that were tough to bond with.

The new transformers were just silly. If there is an attempt to do another one pay attention to X-Men, they continue to produce great movies with impressive characters.

Don't even bother watching it.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Plain and simple, too long and too boring. First things first, why did we need to see the humans story for so long? It felt like I had watched Avatar 5 times before the story got going! Even during all these Robot battles, we're treated to a handful of humans and their running emotions.

By the time we actually see the story unfolding, it's even more boring than the humans' story. This movie does not treat newcomers to the series at all, you'll just be left scratching your head.

By the time it came to the final act, I was just left looking blankly at the screen and not listening, just waiting for the movie to end. How does it end? How it ends in all the other films, Optimus having another speech saying he'll be back and sh*t. This film could have been better if it was only 1hr 30mins. Worst of the franchise, worst franchise in general. DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER ONE.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers: Age Of Extinction is Micheal Bays' latest installment to his not so beloved Transformers franchise. Most people will agree that they are overlong, boring, and only decent because of some cool transformers action. This film is no different. If you have seen any of the films after the 1st movie then you know exactly how this one is going to be. The only difference is a different cast and new looking robots. The story starts off OK but ends up being to bloated and stupid to make sense of. Micheal probably put his least amount of effort into this one. Its boring and so jumbled by the end that you really don't know if you just watched 1 or several movies at the same time. The new cast is almost as bad as the old cast. Shia had a good presence on screen in the first 3 films and Mark has the same feel. Yet, the side cast is flat and ridiculous at times. Not to mention the outrageous 3 hour run time. It seems like it will never end. But if you like going to the movies just to sit and zone out for a while this film is for you. While zoned out you probably also feel Bay stealing the money right out of your pockets. Like always the VFX is top notch. It really does look better then ever. Some of the new Decepticons are absolutely insane and wickedly cool. But cool VFX does in no way save this movie. All in all Transformers 4 is an overlong, noisy, poor plotted movie. The only reason to see this is for the VFX and even then it may not be worth it.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I have been a fan of the Transformer series since if first came out in the 80's. I was a kid who owned the toys starting from Gen 1 and followed the comics as well as the cartoons for many years. With that being said it is probably obvious that I have hated what M. Bay has done to the franchise through his movies, even though I keep hoping he will come around OR his bosses will give another producer a go at it.

I will not argue that the films make money. Some people will go see anything with special effects and big explosions; which Mr. Bay specializes in. Also, Age of Extinction was geared largely to the Chinese population and there are well over a billion of them, so what is the surprise that it made a killing in Asia. The fact is that Bay could not stray much further from the original storyline, and couldn't ruin the series much more than he has. The films are not making money due to his talent, they are making money because they are based on the Transformers. If Bay could actually make a decent movie outside of explosions, special effects, and poor storyline and dialogue; then the movies would likely make much more money then they have. I am so glad that my friends and I paid less than two bucks for it instead of paying for it at a theater.

The only parts of the movie that justify the cost is the amount of time it kills (even though you find yourself asking for the two+ hours of your life back by the end), the action is kind of cool (gets tiresome toward the end as well), Mark Wahlberg is so much better than scream queen Shia, and..... that is about it. They storyline is full of holes, questions, and what seems like rubbish nonsense, or mistakes due to messing with the original and characters, the movie is too long and starts to bore you even with the fight scenes you start wondering if something of importance is ever going to happen. The character development is weak, the daughter-BF relationship drama is irritating and distracting from the main story, and once you start getting tired of it, it never seems to end.

The movie series started out pretty decent with the first film and has constantly declined ever since, with Age of Extinction being the worst yet. I cannot believe that any real fan of the franchise, for all that it is, beginning from its roots, can actually like this film. Nor can I believe that anyone who likes quality films with actual plots that you can follow and characters you can root for, would like it either.

If weak dialogue and characters, fancy special effects, and constant explosions for two hours are your idea of a good, quality film, then you might like this one.

Mark W is a nice change from Shia L, and the special effects are the only reason I gave it two stars.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers: Age of Extinction 2/10- What would a guy like Michael Bay do if he wanted to make more than just a movie that will make money? If he wanted to not constantly get negative criticism because the Transformers movies he makes(with a slight exception of the first) have no plot or character development to speak of and have been called mindless action? He gets rid of every human character from the previous films and gets a badass lead actor like Mark Wahlberg to help him save the film. Unfortunately, even with the addition of Mark Wahlberg, this new installment in the Transformers series falls prey to the same routine of pointless action sequences, terribly written screenplay and dialogue, and as if it wasn't bad enough, we see this dragged on for nearly three hours.

I could have been the one to tell Michael Bay that, yes Mark Wahlberg is a hundred times better than Shia Labeouf, but even Wahlberg can't play a badass while he is standing next to 150 foot tall giant metal alien robot. Not even if you give him a alien space gun that is for some reason just the right size for humans. I believe that he is a good actor but once the transformers enter the movie after about 25 minutes, there is literally no room for good acting left. A lot of people actually agree with me that the movie had some good potential at the beginning, but then the transformers start battling each other and kill it all.

The only reason I did not give this movie a one is because the special effects were decent and I do appreciate, at least the attempt to try to change the franchise(though it was unsuccessful.) No matter how many movies I see, I am always impressed at how digital effects make it seem like a huge gigantic alien robot is right there next to an actor when in reality nothing was there to begin with. So, I guess the film did not screw everything up. I really just wish they would have taken a second to stop and look at the plot that they were making here(if you can even say this movie has a plot.) Everything was just transformers fighting each other all through out while the humans run away. There was not even any final battle to speak of, just a long hour and a half video game nearly. The only thing I liked about the battles sequences was that John Goodman was the voice of the hardened veteran transformer. Other than that, there is no upgrade from the other transformers films.

As I said before, there is not much acting to speak of, but that is in no way the actors fault. They all did what they could and were definitely a step up from previous films. I would like to highlight Stanley Tucci though because he was by far the best actor in the scenes he could help and without a doubt made the movie easier to watch.

I think that if you are a fan of the transformers franchise, you might like this film but you will definitely be wanting something more leaving the theater. For everyone else, I recommend that you wait until this movie comes out on DVD and even then its still a long shot.

Transformers: Age of Extinction,"So after the previous Transformer movies we could expect the worst here but for some reason we got sucked in again. This time because of the promise of Dinobots, and be honest, who doesn't think the Dinobots are cool?! What a disappointment this whole movie became! The story is very unbelievable and although there are metallic robotic dino's, they were just dino's and not saying ""Me Grimlock"". It becomes very obvious this is all product placement and pandering up to audiences in China. And worse, a large portion of the movie us a discussion about underage sex and trying to normalize it. Why? We want to see an action movie with dinorobot's and not some sexual fantasies from the director. Also the end is completely unbelievable: the evil robot owns Optimus and the other Autobots but then 3 humans step in and kick the robot's ass. I mean come on, I understand they need to shoehorn humans in but like this? No way! This is one of the few movies I played with my smartphone for a long time because I was bored out of my mind so avoid this one!",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Another movie with no message. Decent acting, nice special effects.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Name me one movie with a similar budget worse than these movies......

Why would anyone waste so much time on rubbish like this.....

and what's worse the theme sells itself.....

Rubbish.... delete it from the records and start agin... Michael Bay would do everyone a great service if he just stopped whatever this insult to humanity is!!",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Nice special effects, but that's about it. A lame storyline that gets sillier as it drags on, where the outcome is obvious. The 1st 3 Transformers films were pretty entertaining, but now it's just stale. Anyone who gives this film 10/10 needs to seek therapy and perhaps get themselves a boyfriend/girlfriend.

BEIJING, CHINA As apposed to Beijing, France? And I'm not anti-American, but if I see one more fluttering stars & stripes, I'm gonna puke.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Michael Bay seems to be one of the very few directors who actively gets worse at directing movies as he gets older. With the movies he did prior to making the Transformers series, you can at least kinda make the argument that they're watchable if not good. With these movies, they're only watchable if you've never seen an action movie before.

Age of Extinction is bad even by that low bar. There's been very few times in my life when I've actively wanted every human character in a movie to die horrible deaths, but this is one of those cases. This is even worse than the previous Michael Bay Transformers movies: while. Shia LaBeouf and. Megan Fox didn't get great characters in the previous movies, I didn't really want them to die either.

To Age of Extinction's credit, it did indulge me on one occasion early on. T. J. Miller's character dies fairly early on in the movie. Unfortunately, that left a bunch of other annoying characters alive. It also reveals the weakness of Bay's directing and the screenplay he was working with--ordinarily this would have been a tragic death, but here it was just a relief.

This death also reveals one more issue with the movie. T. J. Miller was ostensibly the movie's comic relief character, but he wasn't funny. Even the previous movies were able to perform some very basic comic relief. The ""stop lubricating that man"" scene in the 2007 movie was a juvenile joke, but at least it was kinda funny if you were drunk or high. Age of Extinction couldn't even pull that off.

I think where Michael Bay and the writers responsible for these movies generally don't get is that nobody really cares about the human characters in these movies. They could make them just two hours (or, in this case, closer to three hours) of robots fighting nonstop and they'd be better movies. These aren't really the kind of movies where there needs to be a lot of focus on anything other than the robots.

With the exceptions of Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and possibly Megatron, you're not really going to remember the names of any of the other Transformers featured unless you've seen the movie a bunch of times or if you were a fan of the toys growing up. For the most part, any one of the Transformers that isn't one of the Big Three is probably just going to be labelled as ""Oh yeah, that one"" in your head.

The best thing I can say about this movie is that the action scenes in this movie were generally easier to follow than the action scenes in the previous movies. If you've seen the previous movies, you'd probably consider that an improvement. The downside to this is that (according to IMDb's trivia section for this movie) there's only seventy minutes of action. That leaves you dealing with the grating task of watching the most annoying characters imaginable for the other ninety-five minutes.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"A lot of plot holes, unnecessary storylines, a bit of confusing moments, the human villains should have been stabbed by the protagonists. However the battle cry music from imagine dragons is awesome.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This movie is very bad.

The story is very stupid, it is very incongruous, it has many conveniences, it is full of sentimentality, the plot is very similar to the previous ones, with this film, the previous ones stop making sense, it is predictable and in this film it is when it feels repetitive the saga. The performances are bad, the special effects are not at the level of the previous ones, there is poor character development, the humor that it uses most of the time does not work.

This movie is very incongruous in terms of the origin of the story, just as it is tedious and feels like it has nothing different from the previous ones.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Since it's on Netflix now I wanted to rewatch for old times sake. Overall I loved transformers concept no matter how farfetched the idea might be. It was cool and most got that.

During the first scenes, when the guy says this is our planet while having the American flag and the constant mentioning of American pride while the history is full of stealing from native Americans it's just a comedy at this point.

The thing that baffles me tho is how can you have such a big buget for special effects, but can't afford a good script. Even a decent one maybe, but not this joke.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I am a huge Transformers fan and absolutely loved the first three movies. After the first one my brother and I even followed on with some of the old TV series Transformers from DVDs we had bought and later on Transformers Prime.

With the first three movies there was consistency with actors, characters and story-lines. You could make clear connections from one movie to the other and you could understand the plot. The Autobots were badass and you recognized them by their personalities, and by the vehicles they transformed into. Human interaction wasn't weird and it seemed that both robots and human beings had a mutual respect for each other.

Age of Extinction completely destroyed the Transformers franchise in my opinion. I can't remember if I first saw it in cinemas on my birthday or later on, but I can definitely remember not being impressed with it. I couldn't make the connection between the last movie and Age of Extinction and couldn't understand who the new 'bad-guy' was what his story was, where he came from, nothing. There wasn't really any substance as to why all the Autobots were being killed off either. The new actors tried their best but I must admit that I couldn't find connection with them either because they weren't the ones I grew up watching. The movie lacked charisma and to be honest the Dinobots weren't all that impressive either. For such an addition that is so important, their revelation was poorly done and the amount of time they were actually seen was very little. Throughout the entire movie, I didn't know who any of the other Autobots were except Optimus, Bee, Leadfoot, Brains and Ratchet. Overall I did not understand the plot of the movie. Full-stop. There was nothing that pulled at my heart- strings or that would leave a lasting impression. I'm a pretty big Michael Bay movie fan, but I feel that he lost the plot with this movie completely and literally. His movies are great if they're done right... This one wasn't. The only reason I gave this movie an extra star is because CGI and SFX were pretty good. You can always see improvement when it comes to movies that contain loads of CGI and SFX.

As for the next movie that's coming out (The Last Knight), I don't see how it would be any better; but I might be wrong. The trailers make it look alright, but that's as far as I'm going with that. In fact I am not fascinated or impressed at all about Optimus becoming a Decepticon -if that's even the correct terminology still used. The only reason I'm going to make a note of watching it is because Anthony Hopkins is in it and he's one of my favourite actors.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,This film is totally garbage. this is the worst transformer film in the the series and if you think the the all three parts suck then it beat them all. the visually effect in this film at some point was cheap and the acting one of the worst and the script hahahaha Hilarious. if you are little smart and read any novel then you watch this film you know that this film is garbage. The Dialogue of this film is worst and i have never seen a film which this much worst dialogue. Ehren Kruger write this film and i advice you never watch is film he is the worst writer and he should be forbid to write any film and the transformer look so garbage and i do not know why so much people watch this film and gross more than 1 billion dollar never watch any transformer and the 5th part surely be also the worst. this film is so painful when you watch it never see any transformer.,2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"""obnoxious, insulting to their intelligence, far to long, awfully written, stupidly loud movies with awful character design and messy confusing action sequences where you can't tell what's going on"" Is what most critics say about the first three Transformers movies. I love the first three Transformers movies and highly disagree with them. Funnily enough those words are exactly how I would describe Transformers 4. I rewatched the first three after seeing the fourth one just to double check that I actually did like them and I do, I think they are glorious stupid fun. This movie was to stupid, to loud, to long, to insulting, to nonsensical, to confusing, to patronizing for even a jar-head like me who likes these bloody movies.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I remember having just a few Transformers toys as a kid and also knowing a rich, spoiled kid down the street named Michael who had the entire collection. I was jealous, of course, but what was worse is that the spoiled kid didn't know the Transformers storyline and it was annoying to play with him because he'd use the toys in the wrong way and it sucked the fun out of having access to his incredible toy collection!

Watching these movies has caused me to re-live these frustrating childhood memories because another kid named Michael (Bay) also doesn't know the storyline.

LeBeouf and all of the CORNY supporting actors all left for whatever reason (thank goodness). Would this mean a more faithful approach to the original Transformers series? SO HOW IS IT EVEN WORSE?! This was a good chance to reboot the franchise, a fresh start, a new direction BUT again the rich spoiled kid RUINED IT !!! This had an even worst storyline and despite the fantastic visuals, action sequences and sleek cars/robots (which is the only reason I rated it 2 stars) - THIS PLAIN OL' SUCKED !!

The only good thing is that I rented it and didn't waste anything more than a buck fifty and TWO AND A HALF HOURS !!! It hurt to watch this movie and I couldn't wait for it to end !!

For the love of Optimus Prime, spoiled rich kid, if we are cursed to watch another one of your movies to this franchise - - - sacrifice some of your beloved visuals and over the top explosions for good storytelling and good acting!!! Let go of the awful writing and contrived attempt at humor !! Let someone else who is more familiar with the REAL Transformers and give us some hope to watch and re-live childhood memories that made us all fall in love with such a cool series that the Transformers name used to be! As a matter of fact - If you really do love the franchise and its fans, more than the $$$ , listen to your Autobot leader and ROLL OUT !!",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I didn't think it possible to make a Transformer movie worse than the 2nd one, but compared to Age of Extinction Revenge of the Fallen was quite watchable. I still cannot believe how terrible the editing was. No rhythm, no style, no sense - like a rough cut done by a rookie. I guess the editor quit early, because he/she couldn't stand to watch this garbage of trite, senseless dialog (if you can call it dialog rather than strings of words we all heard 10.000 times before), ""action"" without purpose and sexist camera angles any longer. I really did like the first one, which was a fun ride, I could tolerate the third, but the forth I'll never ever want to watch again. It's not even possible to pick at the ""plot"" or the ""characters"", because there simply wasn't any of that. Plot, who needs it, if you have the money for hundreds of full cgi slow motion shots that tell absolutely nothing. If, for a moment, I try to ignore that there was no story to follow, there's still that this whole ""world"" that's so elaborately created, has no physical rules whatsoever. Transformers may crush the concrete floor in one shot but seem to have no weight at all in the next. Bad transformers are destroyed by a hit but human beings survive explosions right next to them. Optimus removes a sword stuck in his own torso, then kills a bad guy by sticking the same sword in his torso. Elevators stay open, because the scene isn't done. Metal (""Transformium"") can suddenly fly through the air but when it ""manifests"" (or whatever) it's apparently heavy. Your brain tries to find some guidance to make this fantasy world believable, so that you can at least enjoy the spectacle, but it's not possible, because this is lazy writing and filmmaking at its worst. It's without structure, without any coherent idea and without a spark of intelligence. Also, I have to point this out again, it's really disturbing how the camera treats the daughter. Yes, Megan Fox was eye candy in the first as well and the shots also focused a lot on her body, but it was still done in a way to make us (also) see her like the main character did, so it told a (tiny bit of) story and transported some emotions. This is no longer the case here, the camera work on Nicola Peltz is simply creepy. And I'm a man and usually don't mind looking at hot women. All in all this movie is like a cry from Bay: Don't watch this! Don't make this a financial success! So that I never have to do another one. But, alas, he failed with that as well. I am also looking at the Chinese audience and ask: Really? (300 million US$ box office!). And my fellow Germans? (Almost 40 million US$ box office!) I gave the second star for all the people who worked with so much skill on the special effects, albeit it was all in vain.",2
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I only give this film a 3 because the effects are reasonably well done. Other than that, the film is just another Michael Bay adolescent hormone teaser for teens with explosions all around. The original cartoons had more creativity and character than this bag of crap. I thought with Mark Wahlberg replacing Shia, we might actually see something better than the last three disappointments. Sadly, I was wrong. For me, this is the last Michael Bay film I will ever watch, whether it be in the theater, on DVD or on cable. It's my opinion that Bay needs to be kicked off of the set and never allowed to return again. If you happen to miss this film, you won't have missed much. Save your cash for something more entertaining.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Well it's that time of year again when we all get to go out and watch the summer blockbusters and they've managed to do in this film exactly what they did in the others its a 2.5hr movie with a 15 min fight at the end stretched over 45-55 mins. It's so dull I got totally bored watching it, it just turned into the fight that would never end. They clearly have been given big cgi budgets from the studio and boy do they mean to use all of it just like the other transformers movies this means that you have to sit through 1 long fight for a hour at the end of the movie which does nothing to push the mediocre plot forward. I can only assume the producers have shares in the companies that do all the cgi. Just like the others you could cut 45 mins of meaningless crap out of the end of this movie and lose nothing not that there's a lot to lose all of these transformers movies have paled in comparison to the story telling and plot lines in the cartoons they such dull movies they should change the names to transformers 1-4 when cgi goes bad and issue you with a sleeping pill when you enter the movie theatre then again them movie is more than dull enough to fulfil that task. If you've seen any of the others skip it you've seen it already.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I always knew that Transformers is that kind of movie which you watch just to get entertained by the robots and the fights. The previous 3 movies, which even not that good, they are still quite entertaining. But not with this one. Bay somehow can even make the not-that-good movie got worse. The duration was too long. The first 15 minutes was such a waste of my time. You can skip it, and will still understand the story. The hot dude typical cast is completely unnecessary in this one. Without him, the film will be just the same. The girl who played the hot chick, somehow can make Megan fox's acting deserves an Oscar. Yeah, it's that awful. Oh and Mark Wahlberg, such a waste of talent. I feel sorry for him.

So, even if you got much idle time and have no more movies to watch, and this is the only one you got left, consider it again, maybe go cleaning your room is worth your time more.

And yet the worst part is that there will be more sequel coming up. Ugh",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Don't go in expecting this movie about giant robots to have a script equivalent to that of the Godfather's, go in expecting those robots to be fighting around humans who like to crack a joke every 5 minutes.

The editing is probably the worst I've seen in a while, but there's enough distractions to ignore it. The script is definitely the worst thing about the movie because at some points your not sure it's a comedic part or trying to be serious. But more often than not, there are laughs to be had.

The movie is full of explosions and lots of shiny robots. Characters are all shallow and more specifically all the transformers are good for are cheesy one-liners but it's in good nature. I would like to see the day come where the robots actually have some character development involved, but whatever.

All in all, if you do see it, watch it for what it is: a big dumb movie about robots and humans fighting each other.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Let's just face it: Hollywood should stop putting money in Michael Bay-movies. What a waste of money is this movie. Again. Sensationalism rules, there is no connection to the characters at any time and the acting, directing and script are such a mess. This movie was one big pile of silliness. The only thing that kept me from not walking out were the Dinobots who I really wanted to see. Unfortunately they appear all the way in the end of the movie, and it wasn't really worth the wait because they were only put in for more destruction. And maybe is stayed there because Stanley Tucci is the only actor that rises above the mediocre performances of the others.

The script was probably written by 10 different people who then tossed their ideas in a bowl and picked some story lines blindfolded. Or maybe this was a contest to help the scriptwriters and have viewers send in ideas what to put in the next Transformers debacle? It's 2 hours and 45 minutes long and I have no idea why. I think 1 hour could have cut easily, it would have made it somewhat better probably. And close some gaps in the storyline. But maybe not. It probably didn't help that the day before I watched this, a plane was shot down above Ukraine containing 300+ innocent people, most of them Dutch, so I was wondering all the time why you would want to make such a film as there is nothing constructive happening. Only destruction all the way through the film. I got seriously fed up with it.

Not everyone I was with shares my opinion about this movie, some actually liked it. But I think this was the last Michael Bay film I have watched in my life. I hope these kind of movies go extinct, really. What a waste.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,I actually watched this movie accidentally. When I thought I booked dawn of the planet of the apes and booked this accidentally. The movie was too long and meaningless. It was more like you're watching some shitty animated cartoon series at home. Too many things happening at the same time. Unable to focus and I don't think so I would recommend it to anyone. The worst part was the length of the movie. My Friends left it half way. Should have been around 100 minutes and that would be more than enough. The only part which was good was the shoot in China and location. That was somehow interesting. Rest of the movie was just OK.,3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers: Age of Extinction

Michael Bay's fourth Transformers movie, and a lot of new characters. With Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela Banes(Megan Fox) totally out of the picture, (Well, Megan Fox was out in the third part itself), there was some hope that this one could be different.

The movie starts with Cade Yeager(Mark Wahlberg) buying a rusty old truck which later proves to be a turning point of his, his friend's, his daughter's, his daughter's boyfriend's life! Yes!! That escalated quickly! Apparently KSI company is developing their own transformers from a 'seed' for transformium that interchanges between any metal provided by Lockdown(A Cybertronian bounty hunter) in exchange for Optimus Prime. However, KSI had already been making improvised transformers using data from Megatron, creating 'Galvatron' and stronger decepticons than ever!! But to make more decepticons Megatron needs the 'seed' which was with the CEO of KSI. Now it is the autobots and Mark Wahlberg's duty to save the world from the savaging stronger-than-ever-decepticons. After ravaging half of America and China while trying to stop the decepticons from destroying the world, the autobots realize they are too weak for the new and improved decepticons. So, they resuscitate the dinobots!! I don't know where they came from or maybe I was too exhausted from all the severe action sequences among a bunch of machines to notice or may be Spielberg ran out of luxury cars, the dinobots were robots who could change into fire breathing dinosaurs!! Somebody has certainly been doing a lot of imagining. After some more bloodshed, you know, spilling machine oils and wires and metal parts being blown and pulled out, the KSI's decepticons drones and Lockdown are defeated, and ultimate prospective father-in-law and son-in-law bonding, ending the movie with a happy ending (Not sure the U.S. and China people will agree, who were still working their a**es off and going to work in Metros where there was a serious alien uprising going on. Corporate culture. Phew!). Optimus Prime leaves with the 'seed' to find the creators and, Galvatron survives and swears on revenging Optimus leaving us in terror that there will another sequel. Sit back for almost 3 hours of expensive cars randomly chasing each other, some will be transformers and some will be just cars driven by humans and good luck with keeping track over who is after whom! Large gigantic machines wrestling and destroying cities more than a 9 pointer Richter scale earthquake would do. You don't have to make popcorn before the movie starts, you will have plenty of time to do it or even take a nap while the movie is running and trust me you won't miss much!!",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I cannot even summarize the setup for the movie. It's pretty much incoherent rubbish. So we have Marky Mark there, who delivers pretty much your typical Marky Mark performance, as an INVENTOR type of guy with no money. We have a daughter, that is - Bayification alert - gorgeous and has for the entirety of the movie perfect pink lush lipstick on. We have her boyfriend, an Irish wannabe, that is a very annoying character without purpose other than make Marky Mark angry. These characters are supposed to be the emotional core of the movie. However, never, during the whole 165 minutes, you care at all for them.

And of course, we have the Autobots with Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and others. Well, they are the same as in the other movies, with new designs. You also have some new Transformers making an appearance, which is visually interesting, but does not constitute to a somewhat interesting, sensemaking, or logical plot.

The plot is convoluted without measures. You have no idea why any of the ""vilians"" do what they do. There is a macguffin again, there is some mentioning of a higher power that created the autobots, there is government conspiracy again, there is an industry guy that wants to make a profit. Plot holes over and over - do not engage your brain in following the story, only use your occipital lobe for the visuals.

Indeed, the film feels like a ride on an amusement park. You watch people stumble from one set piece to another. Why they do that, is not important. The visuals are striking. The amount of detail in the action shots with stuff exploding, autobots crashing, buildings crumbling, and dinobots fighting is impressive. Add a few fanservice shots of the daughter in lovely sunlight and numerous hero posture shots for Marky Mark, and the visuals are nothing really to complain (except maybe a car jump scene pretty much at the beginning....I think physics were not well portrayed here).

Nevertheless, the action feels plumb, it has no weight, and the fact that the movie stumbles from one action scene to another, kind of weighs you out. You even get tired of the action.

Given all these problems, I am not sure for who I can recommend this. if you like CGI and robots, and can draw your entire enjoyment from astonishing visuals, go for it. If you want to spent your time in any case with a purpose, do not. There are other summer blockbusters that plainly deliver something, instead of pretty much nothing.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"3/10 An excruciating experience of such low level it continuously invited me to say f**k you to the screen and leave the theater. Let me get one thing clear before this: I am NOT a Micheal Bay basher. I really like ""The Rock"" and ""Armaggedon"" was a film I watched really often as a child and now has become a great guilty pleasure of mine. On the other had I really don't like the Bad Boys film and have never loved any of the Transformers one. Sure I liked the first one, but the second and third did nothing for me, yet I was never a total hater of them I still managed to find some good things out that managed to somehow keep me watching them until the end (my votes for them are 4.5 to 5). I will not hate on a Bay movie just because it's a Bay movie. Furthermore I actually think Michael Bay has some great pluses on his side: for one he can shoot the living hell out of anything and no matter what his CGI shots will 99% of the times be fully credible. Yet this cannot save what Transformes 4 is. Whilst in its two predecessors we could perceive a sprinkle of a storyline that managed in some way to bring us from point A to point B here it seems the filmmakers have totally forgotten what storytelling is: if there had to be given a grade to this movie only on the basis of its storytelling it would be zero. There is simply nothing here. No character feels in anyway believable both in his/her dialouge or actions, things are thrown at you on the screen and so many times you have no idea where they came from or what are they doing there. This movie has such a bad and vicious story it drives me mad to think that it actually managed to get on the silver screen in these conditions. The action feels boring 95% of time and for most of it you simply cannot make out clearly what's going on because of an overload of CGI that contributes driving you mad. I don't even know how to start addressing the length problem of this movie because I cannot comprehend how an editor and Bay could have actually thought this sprawling, unbearable length was minimally acceptable. In regards to editing of cuts this thing was so unbelievably fast and repetitive I thought I was cgoing to have an epileptic attack. The screenplay is basically a roller-coaster of shitty mess, so bad at times that you actually feel as if you're watching someone play a video game of the 90s and listening to that dialogue, characters are throwing random annoying one-liners here and there and the more you go on the worse it gets. The movie manages to fail even in the sound department (its predecessors at least were good in this matter): the editing is totally random and alternates moments of mute action to very loud effects in a maniacally horrible way. lets just not get started on the direction which is totally out of control or the ethics of this movie that left me disgusted. All of this adds to an experience of anger and torture that made me frantically move around my seat in the theater and managed to get me up on my feet out of boredom or disbelief multiple times. I was physically shaken both inside the cinema and when I got out: this thing was a disaster. The movie manages to save itself from being defined a useless pile of total garbage thats to the talent of Mark Walberg and some of his fellow cast members. They somehow succeed thanks to their charisma in keeping you awake and with your eyes pointed to the screen. The youngsters too here don't give bad performances and contribute in making this mildly bearable at times. You add this to the visual style of Micheal Bay and all in all however stupid and ridiculous this movie was it still maintained a level of watchability and actually had two actions scenes (that add up to 6-7 minutes of film) that were legitimately great and breathtaking. yet on the other hand they made me more angry because they demonstrated that Bay knows his action and can shoot something spectacular if he actually cared about it all.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This movie is filled to the top with discontinuity, bad acting, an absolutely disgusting lack of character development and a plot that seemed to have been written by a five-year-old. It consistently delivered repetitive action scenes; where there wasn't action, it was like watching paint drying. This was punctuated only by the occasional attempt at humor, fished from the old cliché barrel by the very same five-year-old. The movie's soundtrack was also repetitive, 90% of which was made up of explosions. The other 10% was the sound of car engines revving.

The action scenes, which made up most of the movie, seemed blatantly unrealistic. Rockets that, on one hand, launched transformers hundreds of feet into the air barely caused our human heroes to stumble.

In TF4, the only redeeming element was the GCI (just barely). Even this looked sketchy at times- for example, when the flying dinosaur catches Bee. This is the only reason the movie was successful in the least.

To finish up, here is a quote from one of the top critics: ""I think 'Age of Extinction' is amazing fortune telling by the producers! it sums up perfectly where this film is going to end up. However did they guess?""

I'm wondering the same thing",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I loved the first three Transformer movies! In this movie, I don't know what went wrong. The acting is just horrible, especially Tessa. *SPOILER* When Optimus and Gabletron(whatever) were fighting and the giant ship came and picked up Optimus and the car, the dad told Tessa to break the glass. Her response was, ""I'm trying"" while TAPPING the glass. There was no emotion, not even an attempt to 'break' the glass. I miss the old cast of Transformers. The writers could have at least put in some of the old characters to help instead of a brand new cast. Also in the third Transformers, wasn't Optimus's arm cut off? It didn't look like Optimus was missing and arm or had a repair.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I guess it's the time to stop creating this nonsense series. No one know when the Megatron / Optimus Prime will die.

Every new version of the movie, they give new version to recreate Megatron & Optimus Prime.

It is very ridiculous to see, when they are fighting on the streets, no fighter jets come for support. Every one keep watching how they are fighting. Where is the army, Where is the Navy, Where is the Air-force. The enemy space craft travels at low altitude for hundreds of miles, but know one detects it. Ridiculous.

It's fully waste of time and money. If you really want to kill the time, then you can watch this stupid movie.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"For those (surely) few concerned at the film title's hint that this may spell the end of the giant, indistinguishable CGI aliens, then rest assured, the perplexing box-office takings and the recent announcement of a fifth instalment means that there's no end in sight for Michael Bay's soulless, money-churning franchise. For those tired of the sickly, shaky-cam photography, annoying, goofy humour, tactless pandering to it's undemanding audience, and endless scenes of computer effects bashing against one another, this spells disaster. Though Age of Extinction marks a slightly more focused improvement over it's two predecessors, Bay is showing no signs of wanting to create a decent movie.

ssentially a re-boot due to a complete cast overhaul (minus the robots), this fourth instalment offers little in terms of refreshment. Our human hero is now Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg), replacing Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky, but sharing all the personality traits. Yeager is a genius mechanic, turning junk into something useful, though nothing financially successful, as his hot- pants-donning jailbait daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) repeatedly points out. He is essentially the same nerdy, fast-talking every-man as Sam, only he has arms like tree trunks. His discovery of a beaten-down old trunk in a crumbling movie theatre (perhaps a nod to Bay's hand in the disappearance of the local independent cinema) kicks off a series of events which soon attract the attention of corporate-type CIA agent Attinger (Kelsey Grammar).

Of course, the truck is Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), and it turns out that the government are hunting down transformers - even the good guys who helped in the previous film's battle in Chicago. A shady company, headed by Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci - the only actor appearing to have a pulse), is also involved, using 'science' to extract data from the head of Megatron and extracting a new, codeable metal - laughably dubbed 'Transformium'. Anything can be created from the substance, and is being used to develop the company's very own transformers, including Galvatron, who fans of the comic will know to be an absolute beast. When he is unleashed, it becomes apparent that Galvatron has plans of his own. Also in the mix is ancient transformer bounty hunter Lockdown (Mary Ryan), who intends on taking Optimus back to the 'creator'.

It's a hell of a lot of plot, and at 165 minutes, this will test the endurance of even the most hard-core fan of the new movie franchise. Bay clearly hasn't learned anything from the critics. Age of Extinction is the same convoluted splurge as the film's that came before. This time at least, thanks to the vocal talents of John Goodman and Ken Watanabe, the robots can at least be identified amidst the carnage. Without Megan Fox or Rosie Huntington-Whitely to letch over, Bay has employed another useless female character in Peltz, who runs away from explosions in short-shorts and high heels, and has an equally dull boyfriend in Shane (Jack Reynor - whose Irish accent somehow sounds fake even though his IMDb page lists him as having lived in Ireland most of his life). They've been sleeping together for ages so, y'know, the whole sex with a minor thing is cool.

Many critics have dubbed this as the worst yet, but I disagree. Although I detest the use of CGI as a narrative tool, the special effects here are some of the greatest work ever put on film. There's also no outright racist characters, such as the Twins from Revenge of the Fallen (2009), and the whole experience is far less cringe- worthy than it's predecessor's in terms of attempted comedy. But with the film failing to inject any development or evolution into the series, the point of these movies points to just one thing - money. Bay is filling his pockets without a shred of artistic integrity, and as long as audiences keep offering their money for sheer mediocrity, these movies will keep popping up every couple of years.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Oh boy...where to start... Save $10 and 2 hour and 40 minutes of your time. The soundtrack was good and the cinematography was cool but this is one of the most poorly made movies I've ever seen. I was dumbfounded at how boring it was. I nearly fell asleep in the theater. The run time was absolutely atrocious. At nearly three hours it felt more like four. There was at least three different times I thought I had seen the climax only to discover the movie wasn't even near being over.

I came to this movie expecting some cool CGI and action scenes. Instead I got boring characters talking about ""important stuff"" and terrible CGI robots fighting each other. The animation is seriously pathetic in this movie. Transformers 1 looked better than this. But, bad CGI and acting aside, the plot holes and dullness in the story was pathetic and make this movie and utter waste of time.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,The dialogue was some of the worst I have ever heard in a movie. The only good thing about this movie was the visuals. If they had put as much effort into the dialogue as they did the visuals then this could have turned out to be a real hit. Other than that the movie was long and just very disappointing. Kelsey Grammar and Titus Welliver were super stars in this movie. I found them to be probably the strongest in the movie with some of the better dialogue to be had. I did however think that Mark Wahlberg did a good job with what he had to work with. I found the dialogue between him and his daughter's boyfriend to be very cheesy at best. The boyfriend I thought was really bad all the way around and I didn't find any real chemistry there between him and the girl. Nicola Peltz I found to be very good as well and extremely beautiful which could cloud my judgement a bit but none the less when I said the movie had great visuals I was also thinking of her. Hope to see her in some bigger hits.,3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Let me precede this by saying, I was never charmed by the whole Transformers hype, not even when I was a kid, and all the other kids were playing with their transformer toys.

I loved the CGI in the preceding movies, and obviously this one too. Does that make up for it? NO WAY!

I thought the first movie to be alright. The second one I was getting enough of the kid they used. The third one I was like, okay stop, near the middle of the movie. Now to age of extinction. What a fart it was (a 2.5 hour long one), and one let ripped by someone suffering gastroenteritis. I can write a book about it's awkwardness, and how unfunny it truly was. The only funny moment was when they killed off Lucas, who is new to the franchise, never had any character development, and his best friend did not mention him once after that happened. In fact he didn't even cry at the moment when it happened, but he did cry when Optimus Prime left the planet. ALIVE AND WELL.

This movie is a true disaster, avoid it, even if you can buy it one day for a buck, just turn left.

3/10 for the CGI only",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"As the title of my review suggests, besides explosions and CGI this film contains little of any other redeeming elements of film making. At a running time approaching 3 hours, it's just too much time spent watching CGI robots tumbling, blasting, and blowing things up. With such a simple plot line and shallow characters who don't meaningfully engage each other or the audience, this film should be 1.5 hours at the most. In the beginning I was hopeful that Wahlberg's fine acting skills could save it, but it was not enough and I do not blame him for the poor script. You will likely feel more of a connection with Optimus Prime than any of the humans, which is quite sad I think. Michael Bay makes an attempt in Transformers to warn us of the dangers of giving drones too much autonomy, but it is confusedly wandering in between explosions and often difficult to spot. Even for a movie about giants robots battling each other, I found the CGI movement to be non believable and that further disengaged me. On a large screen some may enjoy the panoramic views and Bay hallmark spectacular destruction but if you want anything more than that see something else.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I believe in second chances but also what do they say about trilogies?. Gone is the Americana, the all American girl bending over the V8, the memorable patriotic soundtrack, the awe inspiring locations. Here we are left with a diluted script with a watercolour suggestion of a family we don't really care about and a cliché redemption plot that we do not in the end ultimately warm to, a CGI overdose not worthy of its Directors and Producers. It seems to be filled with Casting second or third choices with a cauldron of accents and whats with the buzz cut leather clad work boot shod hero these days?, it could be that all the wages were spent on the special effects but I can't believe that a higher calibre of Actor was not available or may be it was a hot potato to some when considering Auditioning. In the end it collapses like a house of hateful cards both human and Autobot into an orgy of the usual product placement and vampirish destruction, making suburban China surrender to its consumerist overlords..",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I can not tell you how exited i was for Transformers Age Of Extinction. I mean after 3 movies who feel exactly the same i really wished this movie was going to be awesome. Shia was gone, Megan was gone, Rosie was gone, Sams parents (Thank god) are gone, John Turturro is gone, and they replaced Shia with Mark Walhberg which is one of my favorite actors of all time. So after 3 movies i was tired of Shia and i really really! wished that this movie was going to be the Transformers movie we all wanted. New cast, New story, New cool allies, New cool villains, because i really wasn't a fan of the trilogy i liked the first one, The second one is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, The third one wasn't really that much better then the second but it was bad. And after Transformers Age Of Extinction being one of my most anticipated movies of 2014 this movie was terrible and a huge disappointment. I was going in to this movie not giving a caring about the old Transformers this movie was exactly the same as the others. The only thing i liked about this movie is Mark Wahlberg, OK. He wasn't perfect. He Had some problems, But at least he did something he actually grabbed a gun and helped the Autobots in battle he just wasn't running around screaming BUMBLEBEE!! OPTIMUS!! He actually did stuff and that was a good thing. But he could not help that this movie really is terrible. This is exactly the same movie as we have seen 3 times, Exactly the same FOR A 4 TIME! uh. Nicole Peltz really wasn't terrible in this movie but she was so freaking annoying. But hold on there is her boyfriend Shane. Waoow! These 2 together were so freaking annoying (Still not worse then Sams parents) but they just didn't do anything he was just there because she was there thats it, TJ Miller in this movie was awful, Why? because it's Michael Bays humor. He just runs around saying really annoying stuff and you are just sitting there wanting to slap him in the face. I like TJ Miller! and Stanley Tucci in this movie was OK, He was good the first time we saw him but as the movie kept going and going he got more and more annoying and in the end he was just terrible.But the worst part is that you can see Michael Bay is trying to turn him in to John Turturros character from the last 3 movies. And this movie is way to long. This movie is almost 3 hours long. It dozen't need to bee that long. The scenes just keeps going and going and never end and you really just want the movie to move to the next scene, just please move on! I mean this movie could have ended 45 minutes to early and i still would not change anything. Optimus Prime & Bumblebee are the only ones that are back from the old movies. But exactly as the other Transformers movies Optimus Prime and Lockdown (He wasn't in the old movies but I'm counting him as Megatron because he was the only one who had a character development out of the Transformers) are the only Transformers that has any Character Devalopment. I saw the cartoon as a kid so i know which Transformers is who. The New Autobots are Crosshairs, Drift, and Hound. But for the people who has not seen the cartoon they just know them as. The green one, The samurai one, and the fat one. Once again The Transformers has absolutely no Character development because of the lazy Michael Bay. They are way way Way to many villains in this movie, You don't know who is the main villain. Is it Kelsey Grammar? Lockdown? Galvatron? Stanley Tucci? Titus Welliver? I don't know. As a said This movie just keeps going and going and won't stop, Characters you are suppose to care about but in the end you don't care, Lazy directing, Pase problems, No Character development for both the humans and the Transformers, To many villains, Waaay to long, Ohh how could i forget, The reason why most people went to see this movie, The Dinobots. They are barely in it, They are in the end for probably 15 minutes max, in a movie who is 2 Hours and 45 minutes. This movie is exactly the same as the other movies. Some Action scene at the beginning, You see the humans they are having a problem with something, There is something secret about the government, We see the Autobots and the humans meeting, Something happens, There is a little action scene so the people want get bored halfway trough the movie, and the last 30-40 minutes is nothing but explosions and robot-fights, the only difference here was that there wasn't something with the military. In the end of this movie i was surprised of how bored i got watching things explode and robots fighting. Seriously, The final battle is so freaking boring!! Probalby cause iv'e seen it a thousand times before in the other movies who is 2 hours and 30 minutes long. This movie mad me sad, Bored so hard, Disappointed. I will now never look forward to a Transformers movie as long as Michael Bay is directing it. This movie disappointed me really big and just was a peace of failure 3/10 Terrible Movie!!",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I read transformers comics as a kid and had the toys - but I am not one of those people who get all possessive about their nostalgia. It was time for the next generation to have a go.

Poor next generation. What a load of rubbish they were dished up here.

The story is absolutely terrible - I do realise this is a story about giant robots fighting each other so I wasn't expecting Shakespeare but this was ridiculous.

Plot goes that the transformers are fugitives and all but extinct, then some come back, then the people kill the transformers, then a fight, then some new bad arse ones are made, now the transformers are killing the people, then the bad arse ones turn out to be rubbish, then they aren't, the people are killing the transformers, oh look a giant robot dinosaur that will come in handy, then another fight, then a spaceship thing then credits roll.

The film balances shakily on its CGI. Take the affects away and you have no film. The fight scenes are impressive but move so fast you can't really appreciate them and near-miss fatigue sets in fairly quickly. Every time a good guy is likely to get hurt an Autobot jumps in the way and takes the bullit. This was bearable for the first 20 times then just became boring.

A rubbish addition to a pretty lacklustre reboot - here's wishing the next version better luck.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"As so many others i had been looking forward to the release of the new Transformers movie, but while the trailers for the movie showed promise even if lacking a bit seen against the first couple of movies(always a hard thing to surpass) i was in for a surprise of negativity from friends who had seen it before me the critics reviews, but kept my mind clear, sat down in the couch with some popcorn and readied myself for some awesome transformers fights, but with an shockingly awful story, mediocre character play, the absence of most of the old crew it was an Waste of Money to have bought this movie cause a bad story, sorry excuse for characters it was an movie i shut down halfway for being to bad to even Watch.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is not doing it's genre any favours here. If anyone intentionally steers away from the fantasy spin off movie genre because they expect the experience to be lightweight, commercial and careless - they will find their arguments vindicated by this production. It's too dark and violent for my kids, it's too fluffy and incoherent for an adult.

It is tied together by a complete over reliance on the suspension of disbelief.

OK - it's a film about an alien robot race - so you have to start with a sense of abandoning reality somewhat - but still it would be nice if the film made some degree of physical sense and had some regard for reality.

Human beings subject to massive collisions with buildings, vehicles, concrete and so on - will still sustain some form of injury (other than designer cuts and bruises) even if they are balanced in the palm of a huge benevolent machine.

Put to one side the physical improbability of the action, the script is complete dog meat.

Mark Wahlberg's character oscillates wildly from being the vulnerable, in his own head father, to the protective practical reality guy. The characters benefit from being less complex than that, and stick to be wafer thin and two dimensional. Nicola Peltz is hot, Jack Raynor is handsome. That's pretty much it. Special mention to Stanley Tucci's character, 'Joshua Joyce' is a billionaire inventor with a dark over bearing control streak and an obsessive attention to detail. However, he has a major character flip in the middle of the film that nobody has a second thought about - and he becomes a comedy device that falls in love with his secretary. Groan.

The script is a re-write of every X-Men fantasy - with the usual dreadful diversity sub-plot of treating everyone as an individual and not as a race. To be fair to just about all of the X-Men film (and some of those films are really dreadful) they do that better than this film does. Somewhere in there, there might be a message about people who are hard on the outside are soft in the middle (Joshua Joyce, Optimus Prime etc) and those who are suppose to protect us might not be trust worth (CIA etc) and all that 'more than meets the eye' rubbish.

If the film is - at one point - grasping for a sense of Dystopian, Orwellian edge by showing how the CIA could subvert the power of the White House through personal corruption with a corporate entity - it really falls down. It never really achieves that. Kelsey Grammar might as well turn to camera occasionally and offer us a pantomime laugh and a mustache twirl.

The FX themselves overwhelm the movie completely and it becomes a case of - 'What can we get these robots to do?' - not 'what would help us to carry this film forward?'.

The tenuous link to the dinosaur age is a pointless one that is never properly explored. It is basically there to introduce a herd of big robot dinosaurs towards the end. There is a 'find' at the beginning - with what appears to be a massive frozen T-Rex - nothing else at all to sustain that find or make it relevant in any way - until a place very much later on in the film. It's garbage. OK some of it has to do with a warning about human beings playing dangerous games with genetics - and the haunting reality of being one planet in a solar system of unlimited galaxies and planets - a haunting reminder of extinction - it's badly executed at best.

Look - don't get me wrong - I'm sounding like a snob, I know that. I really do love a good action film too. I love to see a well executed, high body county, massive collateral damage, hero flick too. I love an old fashioned 'good versus evil' movie, and who the hell doesn't love a robot that can turn into an Italian sports car? We all love hot blonde chicks in short skirts, and I have enjoyed a lot of the films that Mark Wahlberg has done. Sadly, this takes all of those ingredients and gets lost along the way.

I think it tries to have a little something that is meaningful within it - and by taking a step in that direction it immediately highlights how ridiculous the whole charade is. It's like turning on the lights in a nightclub. It just ruins the whole thing.

Rather than trying to make something with a bit of meaning in it - it should have just made something coherent, furious, and full of big robots smashing it up. It would've been a lot more fun. Then that viewer who is skeptical of the genre would've walked away saying 'Well it was more enjoyable than I expected' - rather than - 'I feel completely insulted by that'.

You'll never get your money or your time back if you watch this film.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"The 4th installment of the Transformers saga brings absolutely nothing new to the table in this dreadful series. The Transformers once again are mad at their human counterparts who are trying to destroy the Autobots yet again, but are forced to work together to fight off the Deceptions. I'm tired of seeing our government trying to regulate an alien species, it worked in the first film, but now it has become tiresome. What Extinction does promise (Grimlock/Dinobots), it doesn't even deliver, they are hardly in the movie. A complete waste of time, if you have seen the first movie, you've seen them all.

And what ever happened to their unique powers so to speak, the first transformer we ever see, takes down an entire military base, 3 movies later they can barely fight off a few soldiers? I was expecting Michael Bay to change the formula a bit because of all the criticism over the years and figured he would have a few new tricks up his sleeves.....sadly I was mistaken. Hopefully, Mark Wahlberg moves on from the franchise to focus on other projects.",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"How strongly did I feel after watching this movie? Enough that this is my first-ever IMDb review.

I'm unabashedly nostalgic for G1 as so many kids born in the late 70s to early 80s can relate to, but until now I have been OK with the Bay movies. I figured ""OK, the alternate modes are a bit different, but at least we're seeing this stuff in live action on the big screen""... ""OK, they've done some different characterizations (e.g. Bumblebee's broken voicebox; Starscream's lack of usurpation - or personality at all, really; the relatively dumb Wheelie and Brains...), but we've still got Peter Cullen being the same Prime we always had!""... ""Wow, that Devastator is, er, unrecognizable, and, wait, redneck robots?"" - you see where this is going, and I've only touched on a couple of the movies.

Still, the first one I liked, the second one I liked some, third one was OK... just enough nostalgic beats to keep my inner child paying attention, just enough visual stuff to keep my adult brain thinking it looked cool, and overall at least entertaining when it wasn't leaning too hard on Sam being awkward (because reasons!) or the female leads being hot, or Sam's mom being stoned out of her gourd.

This time around, though, several times during the movie I just had to say ""...What?!""

I'll make a handy-dandy list:

1. Once again, the two sides largely comprise entirely new players, rather than more of the established characters from the history of the franchise. (For a second, seeing the blue Bugatti projecting film onto the rock wall near the start of the film made me hope that it was Mirage, but, nope)

2. Plus, the new autobots continue the tradition of WTFery...

Drift (nice, a nod to triplechangers!) is a seriously bad Japanese caricature. I'm not one to call 'racist' at characters just for being stereotypical, and I think 'being offended' is ridiculous in general, but without any kind of backstory on why this alien lifeform picked up so much feudal japan with his spark or scan or whatever, it just feels silly and bad.


Crosshairs is basically an asshole trying to be in charge. You know, like Starscream always was, over on the Decepticon side, because that's how Decepticons think and act.


Hound is a reimagining of a classic character, and I suppose he wasn't too bad in and of himself, but he didn't remind me of the original Hound; and FFS, what is with ""smoking"" a live shell like a cigar?


3. Bumblebee is an entirely different car every time we see him across the movies – long as it's a Camaro, of course. First movie, I understand, older beater car to get to Sam and then he feels he needs an upgrade to impress the girl, but then we get 2 or 3 even-newer iterations of the same Camaro before Bee starts this 4th movie as a 90% black, first-gen Camaro (inarguably the coolest car he has been throughout the movies' run, at least) but then of course switches back to the new 2016 to infiltrate KSI after the '67 version of him gets thrown out. Side note: The word 'Camaro' now means nothing to my brain after that many repeats (and some I edited out). I'm definitely wishing for classic Bumblebee after this many Camaro versions.

4. Probably my biggest gripe, character-wise: Optimus Prime is so angry in this film that he's generally kinda shady-feeling. He even goes against his own philosophy: His big inspirational thing has always been ""Freedom is the right of every sentient being,"" yet as soon as they unleash the Dinobots he goes into ""either you help us or I kill you"" mode. I get that in his position and knowing what they've been through he's rightfully incensed, but that's, I dunno, just not Prime.

5. The Decepticons were well not a threat? Besides Lockdown - operating alone, not really as a card-carrying, faction-loyal Decepticon here – the rest of the enemy threat was pretty minor. Galvatron might have had the mind of Megatron in there, but beyond his nifty pencil-sharpener midsection, meh. Throw in a couple of Bumblebee-cloned Stingers and a host of other Chevy vehicles that don't get names and you've got the robot version of Batman and Robin fighting domino-masked, stripe-shirted mooks in 1966 Gotham. Shame, because Prime and Bee fighting Evil Prime and Bee could've been fun.

6. Transformium. Maybe the biggest WTF of the whole movie. One small point about it: If the stuff can just change into *anything*, as demonstrated, there is no need for the man-made robots to have recognizable car parts. Poof, it's a car, poof, it's a robot – no shared mechanicals or even colors are necessary according to what they show this stuff doing.

As for the actors:

Tessa and Shane – not fantastic, but I didn't actively hate them.

I like Mark Wahlberg in most things I've seen him in, but his portrayal of Cade has zero believability - you don't feel like he's an inventor, you don't even feel like he's actually a father. I'm not *every* dad, but I am *a* dad, to a teenage daughter, and I just can't buy it here.

Stanley Tucci, he's great. He took what they gave him and turned in a decent performance - there could have been a little more gravitas to his heel-face turn, but it'll do.

And Kelsey Grammar, well, he's pretty good at that kind of role - Arrogant General #24561 off the assembly line. No complaints.

Sooo yeah: Hey Hollywood - you keep rebooting Spiderman, Xmen, F4, etc. Why not reboot TF with a team that'll do it more loyally?",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I am a huge fan of the Transformers, been that since I was a kid back in the 80s, I loved the movies too, but this movie ruined just about everything I hoped and liked about them. Too much on all and any level. Too many explosions, too much of a mess, too much talking, too much dialogue gone wrong, too much product placement, too many unlikeable heros. Mark Wahlberg is mediocre, to say the least, you couldn´t care less about his daughter, Tessa,and Shane. Repulsively conservative world view, too martial, Bumblebee either behaving like a teenager or an oversized bodyguard of humans he has never met before, being handled by random humans like a slave, no bonding, no character evolving, no connection, no chemistry, utter ruin. Plot holes everywhere. Shane fastening his seat belt in the middle of devastation, which takes place in China for no reason whatsoever, just to please the crowds. The legend called Optimus Prime, looking like a robot on steroids delivering the one cheesy line after another, ending the kill of Lockdown with the words ""honor to the end"" and then ""defend this family, defend...what they can be"" without providing a single reason and any answer on the reasonable question: Why?! Ratchet has practically been slaughtered, he himself, Optimus, was more than once almost taken out by these same humans and ""what they can be"", he has stated that he is done with humans and Earth but now all of a sudden, having killed Lockdown, the sky is blue again and his creators would be well advised to ""leave Earth alone, for he is coming for them"". Optimus, the leader of leaders, is bipolar or something? Why should anyone care about the Yeagers or any human whatsoever? Then the Dinobots degraded to pets chewing on highly advanced robots, which by the way can disassemble and reassemble themselves anytime on a molecular / particles-whirling-in-the-air level, but are exactly that easily stabbed, beheaded, shot at, dismembered and chewed upon by just about anything. Then the product placement which has here gone to extremes. Then random new Autobots out of nowhere, no justification, no plot involvement, just guns and random explosions all over the place. Then Galvatron or Megatron reincarnated complaining around with a high pitched voice calling to ""his brothers"" that they find him ""that Seed"" and having no share in the story whatsoever other than a few explosions and a lot of ruin ""his brothers looking for the Seeeeeeed"" cause. Then Galvatron disappearing just as easily with the words ""we will meet again, Prime"". Seriously? That is the all-powerful Megatron reincarnated? What are you? 12 years old? It is supposed to be Megatron for crying outloud. I could go on forever and it would not change a thing. This review is the exact same mess the film was. What a disappointment! 3 stars for the very nice rendition of a very virile independent Lockdown and the Dinobots randomly ruining anything in their pass (but unable to coordinate their own movements...anyhow, I am done here too).",3
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"In comparison to the ""original"" three, the movie is only slightly better than the second one... and we all know how awful the first one was. The beginning of the movie was the best by far: the plot was developing, the characters were interacting, and one could actually relate to the film. However, about 45 minutes into the film it just plummeted. Michael Bay went completely overboard with the explosions, there were even explosions where it didn't make sense for there to be any. The explosions made it impossible to focus on what was happening, and to lose touch with the characters. The lines during the entire final two-thirds of the film are cheesy and cliché. Its a movie that I will happily never watch again.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"*SPOILER-FREE REVIEW*

You know it's a Michael Bay Transformers movie, so despite what the trailers suggest, don't expect anything new... This movie is no exception and still contains the exact same drivel as the previous 3 movies.

Where to begin? Well, this movie isn't all bad. The best thing about this movie is its recasting (aka Mark Wahlberg). Wahlberg's performance is grand and is honestly the best thing about this movie. Although Wahlberg's lines can be somewhat cheesy due to Michael Bay's unorthodox sense of humour, he manages to pull it off and as I've already stated, delivers a grand performance. As for the other main cast, I can really only say this... Nicole Peltz is a slight upgrade from Megan Fox (and 'blonde Megan Fox'). Jack Reynor is simply an unnecessary annoyance throughout the entire movie.

What I've learnt about Michael Bay's Transformers movies thus far is that they display some of the best visuals of our time. The visuals due to special effects (by a team of workers whose names you will NEVER know) are simply stunning and I can now safely say that the visuals are really the only reason I continue to watch these movies.

The bad? I'll save you a lot of time and give it to plain and simple. The plot is an absolute mess. The movies length is WAY TOO LONG. The pacing is sloppy... Wait, in fact, the plot isn't a mess, it's just f**king stupid, it's just stupid. The character's have no development and you're left not giving an flying f**k about any of them! THEY COULD HAVE KILLED OFF LITERALLY ANY MAIN CHARACTER AND YOU WOULD NOT GIVE A SINGLE F**K.

Conclusion, you CAN enjoy this film, although you'll most likely be left somewhat disappointed due to Michael Bay's disgustingly awful story telling. Personally, I can't wait until the live-action Transformers movies get a reboot and are given a more serious director that can actually deliver a well-structured plot.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Yes, here we have it, another dud from director Michael Bay and his army of transforming robots. Only this time it seems, not even the ""fans"" are happy with the Auto-bots/Decepticons over the top antics. Me myself, I really only even seen this because everyone was saying how bad it was, and I curiously wanted to join in with slating it.

In the past, I've probably been more generous than most with these ""transformers"" movies. Although i've never completely liked them, I took them for what they were. Big dumb, Michael Bay action movies. But did we really need a number 4 anyway? Its not like there's an on-going story to follow. Just Bay and his team wanting to suck more money out of teenagers who think these movies are great. Though they really are pushing their luck this time.

Yes, the special effects are still amazing, and the dinobots at least bring something new to the table (Mark Wahlberg and his hot daughter from ""Bates Motel"" on the other hand, do not) but all of the flicks other mistakes, are mistakes that shouldn't be here after the previous movies. There's no story, its too long, has to much random stuff going on in places, and is so over the top in others, that its way funnier when its trying to be serious, than it is when its trying to be funny with its take-them-or-leave-them jokes. No More please. Thought the end suggests we're not done with this rubbish yet.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"The trailer makes it look awesome, we have been waiting for this to come out for months and then we go to it in 3d so excited and....it was crap.

I will have to see the next one as he is going to see the creators but my god I just don't like it anymore, I have sold all my blurays of 2 and 3 and given up.

so many awesome parts, but you still think at the end, what did I just watch. yes it long but that doesn't matter if its awesome (dark knight trilogy proves this over and over again)

new optimus awesome, flying at the end into space and making you go, so why did they need a space ship to go to the moon in 3? rubbish.

humans trying to make transformers pretty awesome, then realising they transform like hovering liquid metal particles really rubbish.

new megatron pretty awesome, calling it galvatron very rubbish.

new autobots awesome, having one voiced by john goodman who smokes a metal cigar very rubbish.

new actors awesome, killing one of the best ones at the start rubbish.

dino bots very awesome, waiting 2 hours to see them for 15 minutes very rubbish...and they looked bigger and more destructive before they transformed into dinosaurs so why did they stay as dinosaur form for the rest of the battle? made no sense...

bounty hunter mega awesome, having him so stupid as to not realise that a quarter of his ship undocked from his when he left earth pretty rubbish and stupid! and how many times will optimus get smashed up or skewered or completely humiliated in battle to then be able to turn round and win? my god learn how to make a good fight already...

real disappointment, loads of great moments, but the padding and crap within it just let the whole thing down and every other minute it was on.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Spoiler alert. But then, the movie was spoiled before anyone ever saw it. Rotten, actually. There was potential, but the worms got it.

Dear Mr. Bay; So you and/or the powers that be decided that TF4 needed to focus more on the human characters, probably for reasons of audience/character sympathy and emotional impact. Sigh. Your audience is choosing to pay to see a movie called ""Transformers"". Shouldn't that indicate an audience set willing to sympathize with non-human characters, able to jive with the humanity of sentient beings. Shouldn't that indicate to you that you audience wants to see heroic and villainous transforming robots, not endless shaky-camera chase- and fight-scenes of bothersome human beings running for the goal line with the football (yet again) while one-dimensional transformer characters run defense(yet again). You should have invested more time in making the robot characters more human, more three-dimensional. Flesh them out, and we'd care about them. Your audience is ready to see humanity in non-humans, but only if you put it there.

Example: Transformers Prime, Season 2, Bumblebee's shame and depression at his fundamental ""performance dysfunction,"" and the struggle to deal with inadequacy and feeling like he's not valued as a robot. The authors played it off like the robo-equivalent of erectile dysfunction, and the audience really felt for the guy, even while laughing.

On that note, fix Bee's freaking' voice. Prime's been BROUGHT BACK FROM THE DEAD at least once in your storyline, and recovered from multiple dismemberment and torso perforations. Give Bee a voice. The whole anger/jealousy at Stinger and the ""I hate cheap knock-offs"" thing would have played so much better if his spliced lines didn't sound like background noise.

There were hardly any on screen transformations. None at all for the three new Autobot characters except a few brief half-hidden snippets. Again, ""Transformer"" is in the title. You had a triple-changer character, and didn't even make use of that. So much wow-factor left so far off-screen. And transformium knock-off transformations do not count, because they are appallingly lame. If your budget runs low and you can't pay your CG guys to render transformations, then cut something else. If Galvatron and his minions are all boring cannon fodder who transform from whatever to whatever via writhing levitating cuboid helices, I just don't wanna watch.

Regarding the title and storyline, I think your plot had merit, as far as ""Galvatron wants to use the seed to make lots of material to build an army."" Lots of cool stuff there, room for human idiocy/corruption/foolishness, But the dinosaur extinction tie-in was unnecessary, and way too far from the science we have (and common folks know a lot of that science - people like dinosaurs, in case you didn't notice). If the dinosaurs went extinct because they were all converted to transformium and harvested, then there wouldn't be any fossils, and associated ash layer. But we do have fossils, and indications of a global blast winter and ash deposition. And why would an entire T-rex (which also misled the audience to think the Dinobots were frozen on earth, and would be revived later in the movie) have been left behind, un-harvested? What you could have done: show the seed blasts also raising mushroom clouds. Then at least we could be left to think that most dinosaurs were converted and harvested for raw transformium (that word makes me gag), and the rest died under the global blast winter, leaving The fossil record we all know actually does exist.

Dinobots - you just kinda stuck them in at the end. there's a lot of story there that you just didn't give us. Who are they? Where do they come from? Why were they imprisoned? All we know is that they are some kind of ""honorable ancient warriors"" and Optimus is apparently some kinda knight who once went on a crusade, and who the Dinobots might know of and possibly have reason to respect. Fill us in! What's all that? Don't put it in at the climax (where we need to CARE about what's happening) if you don't give us the knowledge and context to understand enough to care. You can't just stick Dinobots in cuz ""well, people like Dinobots, so let's do it."" You're doing the whole TF story from scratch, so everyone needs an origin, and character traits. The four Autobots were bad enough, but at least those cardboard cutouts had ONE dimension. Your Dinobots didn't even get to speak, and you made no use of their humanoid forms. Just imagine what you could have done with that! You wanna see a real Grimlock, fully realized with heart and soul, oomph and chutzpah? Wanna see a Grimlock you can care about, cheer for? Go see Godzilla.

Soon the Star Wars geeks will get to see a film without Lucas at the reins. Please, do the same for us TF fans. Or, better yet, redeem yourself - hold your script-writers, your actors, your audience, the story, and mostly yourself to a higher standard. Apply respect, intellect, cunning and artistic craftsmanship to your next treatment or the Transformers, and the audience will thank you. And you'll still rake in the dough.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers 4: Age of Extinction

Transformers: Age of Extinction is the latest entry in the Transformers ""saga"" from director of awesomeness: Michael Bay. The movie also stars Mark Wahlberg, but his performance is less than noteworthy. I said previously that I wasn't going to review this movie, but I decided that it could only be fun, so here we go. Get ready for sarcasm.

Story

After the events of Transformers: Dark of the Moon, all the Autobots are being hunted down by the government with the assistance of some freelance evil transformers. These evil-but-not-Decepticons-for- some-reason want to capture Optimus Prime in order to add him to ""the collection."" The government, in their typical selfish way, are hunting down the Autobots and Decepticons collectively and melting them down into. Wait for it.. TRANSFORMIUM. Ignoring the absolute awfulness of that name for a moment, Transformium is a sort of genetic-metal that all Transformers are made of. Funny that it hasn't been mentioned in any of the previous films. Hmmmm. Anyway, some government corporation has re-purposed the Transformium and is using it in order to manufacture their own Transformers. The idea is that the government will then use these robotic soldiers to rule the world or whatever.

This fictional corporation, which also has a dumb name that I can't remember, makes a prototype named Galvatron. Galvatron is based on Megatron's genetic code and, unsurprisingly, he becomes self-aware and develops the urge to rule the world. Thus ends the Transformer portion of the story.

Now for the human portion. Mark Wahlberg is a Texan mechanic with a daughter who I think is supposed to be the ""love-interest"" because she basically fills in for Megan Fox from the first two films. Marky Mark discovers Optimus Prime in a basement somewhere and repairs him. Optimus then saves Marky's family from the evil government agents and Mark Wahlberg decides that he owes Optimus and spends the rest of the movies repaying his debt.

Obviously, the Transformer storyline is way more interesting, albeit a little ridiculous. My biggest problem with this movie is that they repeatedly enforce the idea that Transformers are not just machines, but living things. But the movie never develops the Transformers' characters. Instead, it focuses on the boring humans leaving the Autobots for which the movie is named are left looking like side characters.

Besides, the plot doesn't really evolve throughout the movie and at the end, almost nothing is resolved. But hey, no one watches Michael Bay movies for the plot anyway. He's the master of explosions! So if you just want to see lots of action and good fight scenes, then this movie is up to par. At best.

Acting/Dialogue

Mark Wahlberg is arguably the biggest star in this movie, but his performance seemed forced. I don't think any of the actors in the movie actually wanted to be in the movie. Regardless, I will give out the award for best human actor and best voice actor.

Best Transformer: John Goodman for his performance as Hound. He is by far the most funny and interesting Autobot in the movie.

Best Human: Stanley Tucci for his performance as the CEO of the evil corporation.

Dialogue is poor. Very poor. Composed of bad one-liners the script is uninteresting and unoriginal.

SFX/Action

Here it comes. The category that everyone wants to see, especially for this movie. Does Michael Bay live up to his reputation as king of the extreme?

No.

Alright fine, I'll elaborate. Nothing looks real in this movie. Fight scenes don't usually play out like you'd expect them to. Granted, transformations look really cool and fight scenes have a lot more detail than in previous movies.

The explosions are what got to me. Arguably the most appealing feature of a Michael Bay film are his epic non-cg explosions. In Transformers Age of Extinction, every explosion is way too over the top. With fireworks literally exploding out of nowhere, everything just seems unrealistic.

Note: 3-D did not add or subtract much from the movie at all.

Conclusion

When editing this review I realized I went a little too easy on this movie, as I tend to do. Just to clarify, I did not like it at all. I give Transformers 4 a 4.5/10. If you still want to see it, I recommend doing now while it is in theaters. The special effects, despite their cheesiness, won't look as good unless they are on the big screen.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I have always been a Huge transformers fan but this one was a let down for me.

Firstly, I have to say Mark Wahlberg's character Cade Yeager topped Shia LaBeouf's performance of Sam Witwicky by a long shot and was the best decision they ever made by replacing the main character!.

1. There was too much human interaction in the film, even though mark's performance was exceptional, there was not enough action with the transformers and seemed like they spent most of the time just talking to each other

2. The idea of changing how the transformers actually transform made it unbelievable for me. Yes it is a Sci-fi film but this turned it into a magical film and not a robotics one. They need to keep the change from transformer to electrical appliance (car / van etc) the same and not have some mystical dots float through the air to create a robot.

3. The last fight scene was awesome! and lasted for a good amount of time but that was the only decent one. they needed more slow motion shots and more intense weapon draw moments. we want fighting robots.. not listing to them talk for ages!

4/10 for me.. hope i haven't added any spoilers",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) is one for the shower. It is an endless two hours and forty minutes, made strictly for an illiterate, masochistic audience who seek out movies that will bang them over the head and deafen them. The rest of us may feel so wiped out that we will need to run home, take two Bayer aspirin, and wash off the residue of director Michael Bey's masturbatory excesses. Bey has made enough money pleasuring himself to toys that he could put a serious dent in the national deficit. That says a lot about contemporary movie executives and perhaps even more about the typical moviegoer.

That aptly named Age of Extinction could very well be a prophetic symbol for movies as a meaningful form of entertainment. To say Transformers is soulless is too much of a given. I cannot imagine anyone even talking about the movie afterwards, except perhaps out of sheer embarrassment for having dragged oneself in to see it. I am unsure how many of these movies have been made, and have no desire to find out after having seen this one; but the fact that a series of Transformers movies have been produced already almost guarantees it making a gazillion dollars off numbed contemporary audiences forever looking for sensation devoid of feeling.

Based on the Hasbro robot toy line, Transformers is too pornographic in its violence to be seen by children, and any parent taking their kids to see it should have their head examined. The actors, who include Mark Wahlberg, Kelsey Grammar, and John Goodman, are in the nadir of their careers. They are lost among scraping metal, explosions, and countless product placements, which at least provides minuscule relief from all the ""noise, noise, noise."" Unfortunately, like Boris Karloff's Grinch, we are rendered powerless in our attempt to shut it all up because the noise is the only thing that prevents us from succumbing to complete boredom. Death from boredom would be far preferable, however, and leave less wear on the posterior. Robots are supposed to be cool, and despite having robots who can turn into cars, Transformers can't inspire any emotion besides lethargy. I kept asking myself how Bay could manage to make robots dull, until I remembered that Clint Eastwood worked hard, and successfully, at sucking all the fun and poetry out of the Western and transforming it into a hopelessly vacuous genre.

Not helping the robots is shockingly asinine dialogue delivered by Goodman (in voice over), Wahlberg as a mad scientist type, and Grammar as the stock CIA exec. Incredibly, the girls in the movie are even more witless, reduced to cardboard whores for Bay's fetishistic lens.

Transformers is not so much a movie as a heavily advertised media event. Doubtless, the besotted businessmen funding this clanging, metallic peepshow fancy their product as imaginative enough to rake in plenty of dyed green paper from its zombified audience. To be certain, the producers will be quite busy tallying their profits, but all that green is rendered an illusionless illusion because, although good movies are still being made, American Cinema is broke, and all the king's horses and all the king's men will not be able to put it together again.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers was a great film. it introduced us to something we'd never really seen before as an audience: giant CGI robots fighting each other. it would be later used in other movies... A LOT of other movies... Anyway, back then we loved it. The Revenge of the Fallen? My goodness what a GIANT STEP BACKWARD! You really couldn't get worse than that. The third one, I WILL admit was about a baby step forward.

You remember how i said you couldn't get worse than TF2? I guess YOU CAN

It was the SAME THING AS THE FIRST! Big robots, big boobies, knockout women, stereotypes, your typical Bay movie. Well, this time we have, Mark Wahlberg, Stan Tucci, Kelsie Grammar, and... um... that girl from The Last Airbender? Okay...... Not much else to say other than the fact that the film is convoluted, long, undeveloped, and just stupid. Just see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes...",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers can be fun. It actually can make mediocre stars, like Shia and Mega, but this movie does exactly the opposite. I wander, how exactly Michael Bay allowed this catastrophe to be filmed and shown. It's as he doesn't care about the legacy of this great franchise. Truly reminded me of Terminator 3 fiasco. Acting is bad. Real bed. There is not even one actor in this movie that worth to watch. Wahlberg's portrayal of Inventor, ""sort of white trash"" Texas simpleton, father to some hot young girl, who btw can't act for s..., is nothing short of ridiculous. Everybody else, including usually great Kelsey Grammar were just bad. The story lacks everything. It's not interesting, it does not suit previous three movies (I mean two of them weren't good, but at least they had running logic). It's boring and entire movie relies on special effects. Robots became more human-like, except for ever-charming bumble bee, but still his behavior became stupider than before. Waste of time. From now on, I'll choose Wahlberg's and Bay's movies more carefully. Gave this one a 4, because of god special effects. That's it.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers(4) : Age Of Extinction - ''When u change the characters and won't give meaningful involvement in them,then it sounds like what happened to ''Pirates of the Caribbean 4''(it becomes bad)...You get to see obsession of Michael Bay towards explosions..movie lacked grip in screenplay,terrible job with sounds,u just hear metal junk rusting and making ear bursting noises(empty vessels make much noise),this time it's mostly dark nd so I can't even judge(not even see)who's beating up who??just junkyard collisions!.. The comparative good part of movie is found earlier itself and later on how dramatic or cool the shots maybe,u won't find them cool as THAT 'Aawww' moment is lost!....visual effects are only good part(not in all the shots)and some 'cool' fights too...

Transformers: Age of Extinction,"One of the attributes of some avant-garde films is that there seems to be no plot, or so little, that like modern painting the color or shape speak for themselves. Transformers – Age of Extinction appears to be faithful to this description and should, therefore, be considered a subversive piece of art. But let's explore it a tad more.

From the days of Bunuel and Dali and Léger and other avant-garde pioneers, the supposed intention of a seemingly unarticulated and dysfunctional narrative was to comment on mainstream filmmaking, to create new meaning through the finding of a new film grammar and syntax. It worked, for the most part, from Paterson to Kubelka to Brakhage to Deren.

Will one day someone come up with a brand new book about Michael Bay, avant-garde filmmaker?

It is true that we can barely glimpse the shadow of a story dripping off the brouhaha of clanking metals and steel in TAOE; and it does look as if they intended to show us a rough print of the movie. Can't wait until they come up with the Special Edition: The Edited Version... Would maybe amount to a viewable 45 minutes.

However it is also possible that Michael Bay wrote the equivalent of a Six-Flag ride for the screen because one question will be worth asking for the hypothetical book: Can plot less narratives and messy visuals be the new avant-garde? It can certainly not be an independent cinema! With over one billion in revenue, TAOE does not qualify as an indie film.

Human characters motivations are weird at best and submitted to the will of the runaway train which substitutes for a narrative, and their stories. What to think of old teenagers in love, a confused father... a bizarrely intentioned Defense official whose behavior cannot be explained (if he hates all transformers so much, why does he trust the robotic bounty hunter?...), a CIA assassin who seems eager to revenge his sister, a captain of the industry making a 180 following a simple phone call, etc. All seem to have very little to do with the fact that earth is about to be annihilated, as one reviewer noted.

OK, maybe it is a comment on our selfish society? Maybe; we do worry about ourselves first and think little of our neighbors' plights, much less the rest of humankind.

But here's how TAOE can't be categorized as either an indie or avant-garde movie: every single plot development (big words for this film) or character action/choice is automatically motivated by whatever will create the greatest bang and destruction. The China sequence is a good example as the ""bad guys"" decide to search and kill the ""good guys"" only and only because the alternative would have meant less explosion.

The different pauses in the narrative exist only to provide us with a breather; you see, these pauses are plot holes in their own rights. Some of those pauses are caused by killers and the bounty hunter losing sight of Optimus Prime. There 's absolutely no rationale behind the bad guys losing track of Optimus Prime... twice (one of them when they were practically sitting on him).

It is interesting to see how many movies today (Hollywood and otherwise) are constructed as a visual ride with very easy to dub dialogs (camera rarely remains stable long enough to see lips move, so it's very convenient to realistically dub actors) and replaceable characters. This reminds me of the early silent comedies which were international successes because the visual spoke to everybody of any culture: same with a Michael Bay flick. A non-Michael Bay movie, Pirates of the Caribbean was based on a park ride, but at least they made it into a movie! Today's movies, for some anyway, are turned into a ride, to speak to more than local spectators and satisfy a global audience, maybe? Portion of the story happens in China (with very little plot justification, if at all!) most likely to appeal to one fifth of the world population...

I haven't really tried, but is there one, just one stable shot, not movement or zoom or anything, in the entire film?

A nearly three hour movie, over a billion dollars worldwide... Well, hundred of millions of spectators can't be wrong: they love avant- garde...",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Michael Bay is known for over the top action with explosions, slow-mo and plenty of destruction. Sometimes that's good, but a lot of times that's not enough to do it.

I watched this movie for one primary reason: Shia LaBeouf was not in it. He was irritating enough in the first Transformers, but because of its novelty he could not drag the movie down. Well, by parts two and three I had just about enough of him. Exit Shia LaBeouf, enter Mark Wahlberg.

Mark Wahlberg is a solid enough actor in the right role, but even he was annoying in this one. I thought he was going to bring some maturity to the movie but he only played an immature father. Bay obviously wanted some humor and comedy, but he'd been better off bringing back John Turturro for that.

Besides the cast, the Transformer saga was much the same. The fighting was for slightly different reasons, but there was still clanging metal, impossible stunts and nice rides. I'll never tire of them transforming, that is probably the coolest part of the movie. But of course you can't make a 90 minute movie of robots transforming. The robots actually were more entertaining than the people were in every facet.

Ultimately, I never finished the movie. I got up to go to the bathroom and decided I was done watching. Any movie that I don't willingly finish I cannot give a good rating to. I don't know, maybe the moral of the story is more robots and less people would make for a better movie.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"transformers age of extinction is the 4th installment in transformers franchise and is directed by Michael bay here is my reaction and point of view of this movie

towards the beginning of this film it was sort of exciting until after the car chase scene and then the plot just slowed down immediately and it just got boring and boring except for the action but just because it has great action does not mean its great movie i really especially do not like the characters watching this movie was like sitting in a restraint chair wanting to get out in my opinion transformers is once again a bad movie and i mean a badly done film so as a grade i would probably give it a low F to a high D-",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I have watched all the other Transformers movies and I have liked them. I have liked them a lot. Yes the stories have been comic book quality but it has been fun watching them nonetheless. This onenot so much. I was actually rather disappointed at the end despite having tuned down my expectations on pretty much everything except the special effects.

The special effects are good. It has to be said. They are really great. The transformations are cool as ever and the new transformations by the human made transformers adds a nice FX twist. The fighting is gorgeous. The Dinobots were really cool.

However, 165 minutes where the only enjoyment is one FX after another and where the scenes without FX are simply a drag is just not what I call a good movie. It is at best a special effects catalogue of what can be done. A showcase for other movie makers telling them: ""Look how good my team is at making FX"".

The story of this movie is pretty thin. That the Autobots, that saved the planet, should be hunted down again is just an unintelligent and dumb cliché. It could have been made into something usable though if it was not implemented with utter incompetence. I mean, come on, there is not a likable person in the entire bloody movie. Well, with the possible exception of a few side characters. The hero is an ass, his ""friend"" that betrays them is a dumb ass, his daughter is just a dumb poor actor, the chief of staff is laughable. The list goes on. To make matters worse the bad guys that are supposed not to be likable are just bland, dumb arses. No character and mediocre acting at best.

Sometimes the scenes are disconnected with strange jumps in the middle of the action as well. This must be the worst implementation of an already poor story that I have watched it a long while. The only thing that lifts this movie above a zero star rating are the great special effects. For once I side with the so called ""critics"" that trash this movie.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Once again Michael Bay unnecessarily makes an additional film for the Transformers franchise, and Age of Extinction is slightly better than the rest.

After the much maligned and incredibly lazy previous Transformers film, it was almost impossible for Transformers: Age of Extinction to be worse than its predecessor.

As with any franchise that is in its fourth installment, reinvention and recasting reinvigorate the story and premise of the Transformers. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), Captain William Lennox (Josh Duhamel), Agent Simmons (Tyrese Gibson) and even Robert Epps (John Turturro) are nowhere to be found in Age of Extinction. Instead there is a new family that becomes entangled in the Autobot siege.

Mark Wahlberg plays the tech savvy Cade Yeager who is a single father to 17-year old Tessa, Nicola Peltz. After the world-changing battle that leveled most of Chicago, America's relationship and partnership with the Autobots is significantly changed. Government agencies struggle to find the remaining aliens in hiding in an attempt to increase security. The Yeagers become caught in the middle of the crossfire when they themselves find and aid the damaged Optimus Prime.

There is nothing new at all with Michael Bay's fourth Transformers film so it's almost incomprehensible that the movie stretches over two and a half hours. Viewers have seen three movies worth of action sequences using CGI-ed robotic aliens and there is absolutely nothing new in this film. The only exception is we get to see a transformer dinosaur. In my opinion Bay thought having an Autobot dinosaur fight scene would be pretty rad and catered the rest of the story to allow for it.

Maybe as an act of redemption, the production company once again brings to life Ehren Kruger's screenplay, the same writer responsible for all previous sequels to the Transformer's original. It is overcomplicated and attempts to cram far too much sub-plot lines in order to revitalize interest in the waning franchise.

Age of Extinction caters to the audiences that just want to get lost in a mindless summer blockbuster. The character dynamic between father and daughter is cheaply overplayed, exacerbated by mediocre acting from Wahlberg. And yippie, we get another Transformers film slated for 2016 Please check out our WEBSITE for all the recent releases reviewed in full.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION is where I draw the line. Just as I've reached my limit with the DIE HARD franchise, so it is with TRANSFORMERS. I'm done. We're four movies deep in this franchise and the bad outweighs the good so heavily that I refuse to go to a theater to see another unless I see a Rotten Tomatoes score of 80% or above. I understand that guideline might seem a little strict (there have been plenty of great movies where Rotten Tomatoes didn't reflect it with the critics) but TRANSFORMERS needs to really break out the good stuff to get me back in a theater seat to watch another. AGE OF EXTINCTION was an excruciating two hours and forty- five minutes long, and I haven't felt this robbed of my valuable time sincelet me thinkREVENGE OF THE FALLEN. Before you think I'm just a TRANSFORMERS or Michael Bay hater, let me mention that I actually really liked the first movie and I even found a lot to enjoy in the third movie. I hated the second, but I was willing to write that off as a fluke because it came about during a writers' strike that could've contributed to how horrible it was. But this one has no excuse and it's forced me to reflect on the ones I liked (and, for the record, can still enjoy) and realize just how hollow and meaningless these cash grabs are. Michael Bay was originally going to retire from the franchise and let someone else direct the fourth film, but he saw how long the lines were at a new Transformers theme park ride and was inspired by the fans' excitement to return and direct AGE OF EXTINCTION. Don't be fooledit wasn't the enthusiasm of the fans that brought him back. It was dollar signs. He saw dollar signs above the heads of those fans and knew he could churn out another easy paycheck from the suckers. I was one of those suckers, but not anymore.

I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis of the plot for AGE OF EXTINCTION. It's pointless. Let me simplify it. There's a new MacGuffin indistinguishable from any of the others that came before it. Megatron (in his new form, Galvatron) wants to get his hands on it forevil stuff. Mark Wahlberg is the franchise's new hero as a scientist from Texas. Kelsey Grammar is the evil government operative who wants to kill all Transformers and Stanley Tucci is a parody of Steve Jobs who wants to use Transformers technology for whatever. There are a lot of pointless supporting characters, most of whom I couldn't be bothered to learn their names. There's racist caricatures, blatant product placement (ughthe Bud Light moment), and pandering to China in an effort to boost Bay's paycheck even further into the stratosphere. There are a ridiculous amount of oversized and often unjustifiable explosions, and a civilian body count that causes me to wonder why it doesn't receive the same fanboy rage as MAN OF STEEL. Physics are defied for convenience, people are superhuman, and once again I can't tell which Transformer is which because who really cares at this point.

Oh, but wait, I've forgetting about the main draw behind AGE OF EXTINCTION: the Dino-bots! Yes, we finally get the Dino-bots. I mean, they were all over the advertisements for this film, right? And it's got ""extinction"" right there in the title. I mean, this has just got to be a dino-heavy movie, right? No, no it's not. Sure, we get Dino-botsabout two hours and twenty minutes into the movie. And really, you can tell they were shoehorned in to cater to the legion of drooling fans who've been clamoring for them since the first film. And to be honest, I wasn't that impressed with them. They were just more CG vomit thrown into the typical TRANSFORMERS overblown final action sequence where things are exploding around the screen and horrible one-liners are spouted until Optimus Prime lands the final blow and grants mercy to the audience by ending the film. Again, I enjoyed TRANSFORMERS and DARK OF THE MOON. They had some entertainment value. AGE OF EXTINCTION has none. This one is merely an endurance trial to see how much CG robot carnage the audience can withstand. I mean, Bay does remember this series is based on a line of toys, cartoons, etc. for kids, right? I mean, what kid is going to sit through this?

Let's finish with the film's ""characters"". Look, I like Mark Wahlberg. He's done some fun stuff (THE OTHER GUYS, PAIN & GAIN) but I don't buy him as a scientist. If he's a scientist, then Denise Richards is a nuclear physicist. And how does a garage inventor know how to handle himself in armed combat as well as he does in this movie? His daughter (Nicola Peltz) is a sniveling, ungrateful brat who wears shorts way too short for what's supposed to be a seventeen-year-old. Didn't stop Bay from focusing that character on her butt in those shorts, though. Close-up, of course. That was just uncomfortable and weird. Her boyfriend is a rally car driver that's impossible to like because he loves to flaunt to Wahlberg that he loves to get freaky with his underage daughter. You'd think he'd redeem himself later with some heroic stuff but, no, when he's given the chance on the Knightship halfway through the film he proves to be a coward. Kelsey Grammar is a one-note ""evil government suit"" and Stanley Tucci goes from a potentially interesting villain to a joke halfway through the movie. You know who didn't suck in this movie? T.J. Miller. He was the one bit of fun in the whole thing and he's gone after the first half hour. So there's that.

The nicest thing I can say about AGE OF EXTINCTION: at least it's not REVENGE OF THE FALLEN.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This was one of my most anticipated movies of 2014. Because of so much anticipation, I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it. When I was going to see it for a second time, I finally realized that the plot was too long making the movie 165 minutes! It didn't even have a story at all. All there are in the movie are just a lot of loud noises, explosions, destructions, invasions, and long battles that takes place in so many places. Sure, the effects and Optimus Primes riding his T-Rex Dinobot was cool, but that cannot be a reason to say the movie was great. The real focus of the film is the millions of tons of computer-generated debris. That's all. All things where my thumbs are up are on Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci's performances, the soundtrack and ""Battle Cry"" song, and the effects. But get ready for my thumbs pointing down on almost everything except the good things I listed. Michael Bay's movies never changes and apologizes to us. It just continues being awful. I liked the first and third Transformer movies. The second one was fine. This one was bad. And the punishment of the audience and critics are hates on this movie. I'm sure Michael Bay wouldn't direct the fifth movie because of hates. And I'm sure the fifth one would be the Transformers movie apology. Don't watch this.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"I finally got around to seeing the fourth, and most recent installment in the ""Transformers"" franchise a few days ago, and really, I'm going to have to say this is probably the worst in the series so far..?? Now I really liked the original 2007 film. I liked how the ""Autobots"" were introduced to Shia Lebeouf, who we get to sorta experience the whole situation through his character. The two sequels were alright I guess, but this fourth movie was completely unnecessary and gratuitous.

No Shia this time- instead Mark Wahlberg is brought in (playing an inventor-?? yeah right LOL) who, along with her race car driver boyfriend, must save his daughter from the evil transformers. Blah! Boring. LOL I noticed this time around, the transformers are given such human characteristics as to be completely ridiculous/unbelievable- vs. the first film which they appeared as mysterious aliens. And this movie I understand made well over $1 billion worldwide-?? WTF-?? Really? People, stop going to these movies!! Please!! Otherwise, they're just going to keep cranking out more garbage like this...!!! LOL",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This movie is not good. What made it bad most of all was casting Mark Wahlberg as a nerdy inventor. Are you kidding me? that's almost as bad as Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. a 5.8 foot guy cannot be Reacher who is 6-5, 250lbs, and Wahlberg rough and tumbler cannot be a nerd. It's a non-starter, and the movie unravels from there.

He and his daughter have zero chemistry. It looks like they just met! And the rules he sets for her, at that age? Are you kidding me?

I did like Stanley Tucci in a different role as the evil or is he inventor. And kudos to kelsey Grammar and titus wilever as the two heartless bad guys - they were great.

The acting on the bad guys side was great. The CGI robots were actually better this time, not so dark. Usually you can't tell who is fighting who because the filming is too dark. they fixed that. But still, the story - eh, nothing special. Bad guys come - they attack, oh, will Transformers save us? Of course they will! that's not a spoiler btw, they do it in every movie!!!

I'd pass on Age of Extinction unless you really have nothing better to do, or you are a fan of Stanley Tucci.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This is the worst in the series, I actually liked the first two, then the Dark of The Moon and Age of Awfulness were bad!

To be honest, none of them were that good. Transformers nominated three Oscars, Revenge of The Fallen nominated one Oscar. Dark of The Moon (which I thought was bad) nominated three Oscars. This one, where are they? Oh yeah, NO Oscars! This has to be the worst in the series.

Don't waste your money on this trash. The only reason I'm not giving it 1/10 is because it-it.... really I just did because it's not that bad. But still awful.

Go watch something else. And here is a link to a part of the movie, this is how bad the dialog is. And the stupid directing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZLgiwYP5to",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"'Transformers: Age Of Extinction (2014)' is not awful but, just when you think it's been a while since anything stupid happened, the film will throw a racial stereotype or an inappropriate joke (some about statutory rape, no less) or an egregious one-liner or a blatant sequel-bait or an incomprehensible plot-point your way and you'll be reminded of the sobering fact that you are indeed watching the fourth Michael Bay 'Transformers' film. The fourth in a franchise showing no signs of slowing, though relegated to spin-offs it may now be. The picture is just about serviceable in the sense that it didn't anger me, but it is also just plain bland and instantly forgettable. It is also far too long and seems to be making itself up as it goes along. It's the kind of movie that you struggle to remember after a good night's sleep and, honestly, one that you probably don't want to. 4/10",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Yes, we know Transformers movies aren't great, but even as someone who can appreciate 1 and 2, this number 4 is just horrible. You'd think Bay would listen a bit to what people have to say about the first 3 movies and take that into account but no. Or maybe he did and somehow managed to enhance everything that was wrong with the previous movies and crank it into one movie. The most generic actors you can get (yes, even you poor Mark, Texan overprotective father), the CGI isn't as good as it used to be, probably because they're trying too hard to make original looking stuff. And remember Sam's parents being embarrassing for 5 minutes? Well, in this movie, the Mark manages to be embarrassing through the entire movie. You want to see a father tell his super hot 17 years old daughter she can't have a boyfriend, in the middle of a fight for their lives? Yep, that's how low it sinks.

Do yourself a favor and skip this, and if you really need to watch robots punch each other, go watch Transformers 1 or Pacific Rim.",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"The first time I watched this in IMAX had some very annoying circumstances that have to do with saving seats for moronic friends that show up 40 minutes late and getting in a fight with other people trying to take their spot in the middle of the movie. I was annoyed for half the movie.

I liked and hated this movie. I liked most of the stuff to do with the transformers and I hated everything that had to do with the humans. EVERYTHING. The whole cast was terrible. lots of bad acting and horrible dialogue. and it was barely funny when it tried to be. made me realize how great Shia and John torturo were in the last 3.

michael bay went a little overboard with pushing the limits of believability. lots of parts where you say there is no way they would ever survive something like that. some of the action scenes were phenomenal but some of them were a little confusing and hard to follow. a bunch of stuff in the movie seemed to try to mimic what they did in the third one. Definitely a lot of questionable parts but whatever. a lot of corny and cheesy parts

...

very late one night, i wanted to watch a movie but i knew i probably wouldn't be able to stay up for the whole thing. so i picked something fun that i didn't mind stopping halfway thru. and i was happy i chose this one. i looked forward to finishing it the next night.

i keep coming back to this movie. the good parts are awesome. the great parts are amazing. goosebump-inducing. i watched most of the human parts on 1.6x speed. i should've just skipped em. i think you can edit this movie into something half-decent. and i would watch it again but skipping all of the human-only scenes. (4.5 viewings)

The dinobots were amazing tho",4
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Transformers Aee's plot was ridiculous. Even though the scenes of the movie are beautiful, the story handling is bad.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I don't even know where to begin. Everything about this movie is horrible.Really, there's not even one thing that is at least OK. Story is garbage and makes no sense, not to mention the many flaws that is has. Dialogues are...let's say that the movie would have been better without them. Jokes..I'm certain that even a 5 years kid would be funnier than these shitty jokes that only make the movie even worse. I am really sorry about Antony Hopkins but probably he was given a bag of money to act in this crap and say those lame jokes. And Mark Wahlberg...I really believe that even I could have delivered a better performance. It's really just a sad sad movie and it's a challenge to watch it. I was just so bored...it was painful, pure torture. Please do not watch this monstrosity.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Yes, if this is Michael Bay's last Transformers film to direct or have any sort of involvement with I will be happy. Now maybe we can get a director who actually cares about the source material. This film reflects on what Bay is about, good effects, but a flat script, characters that are pointless, and awkward humor. This is the 5th film and you'd think by now it would've improved. Nope, its just as bad if not worse then the last. At least those were somewhat entertaining, this is just flat-out boring. Nothing of interest happens, and the running time is just unnecessary. The only areas I liked in the film was the opening scene. An epic battle of warriors and a three-headed dragon. It proved that Bay can direct action and epic quality. But afterwards, it takes a steep downward spiral into oblivion. Not even Anthony Hopkins can save this mess. A disappointing film indeed and a weak conclusion to a franchise that had such high hopes in the beginning. Now to grade: Acting: C+, Special Effects: A, Story: D-, Music: B, Characters: D+, Action: B-, Overall: D+.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Please let this franchise die! Apart from the last action scene's everything is a total waste. Bad plot, Bad acting, Waste of talent, Waste of money, Waste of everything really. There is so much violence but the story is for babies. That is just awfully awfully written people! No character-building, no logic to the story, no buildup and let a lone some originality. Reboot this hole thing. Or better yet, let someone make a REAL transformers movie but don t call it transformers so you are free of the bullshit Hasbro wants you to do. If you do this: Use lasers instead of guns and follow the true Original G1 story line. Make it darker. Transformers is a battle for energon fought with laser's for god sake (and occasionally a energon blade in close combat). Hell, from the very beginning of the movie, it is clear that the makers are not serious about this film themselves. It is so so bad! which is just stupid because a Transformers movie could be the UGE! Put more effort in a good story line and character build up. Make it darker and more intense in dialogue and intrigue. Only use Bay if you need to get the action-scenes theatreproof, but I could live without if the atmosphere is good through good story, dialogue and screenplay. Make it more grown up. Or make it a silly animation movie that can be shown to 5 year old. But please don't try to do both. I hate the franchise now. Was a fan of the first and the second movie. But boy did they blow it hard. Wurthless... It is so frustratingly disappointing.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Waited to watch this for free and let me tell you, I still feel ripped off. They spend $200m on this? Why? And who is paying to see these films at at the theaters? Seriously how did they gross $40m in the 1st week? Don't people already know these are going to be terrible? Might as well pay $15 per head for Sharknado.

Don't know where to begin. Disjointed scenes, childish plot, no character development, and baby bots? Are they serious? Optimus Prime is now Optimus Wuss. Bubble can talk... and oh, the transformers have been around for centuries and they are the ones driving human history... lets see... Merlin is a drunkard, Arthur is somehow a good guy compared to the people he is fighting because we all know that Britain is awesome. There is a Tomb Raider rip who is also the chosen one (obviously). I mean, this movie brings shame to our entire species. It was written by children for I don't know who. Even as I child I didn't like the cartoon story plots, but they had a reason for that. Namely, they didn't have $200m to spend on an entire season of cartoons never mind 4-5 episodes.

Watch it if its free, if for no other reason than to verify just how terrible the writers and directors are. Then avoid paying for anything else they do.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I am a transformers fan and it feels really painful after watching this movie. I guess human beings in the transformers world are the most dumbest ""Homo Sapiens"" of all the cinematic universe; I mean in almost all their movie they first try to eliminate transformers(or specifically our loved Autobots) but eventually Earth is saved by them (to be just destroyed in next movie), but what I really don't understand is that why they have trust issues with Autobots in the initial part when they are their only way to protect the Earth. That's just not justifiable. However, the story line is good but it is the editing and the way of presentation which causes the dent. I mean the movie is not properly presented to the viewers and its really hard to cope-up with the pace with which movie is going. This is the worst rating that I am giving to any movie; and it feels really bad when you have to give it to one of the best film franchise.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"First I have to admit that I have never written a review on IMDb. After seeing this awful vehicle last night, I felt compelled to write a short opinion.

As a child from the 80s, it hurts to see the uninspirational new transformer-movies. Robotic dinosaurs and robotic knights, really? OMG.

The story is quite absent so I can not really say much about that. After 2 and a half hours of CGI-stuff exploding and spectacle, you just don't care anymore and are frankly unimpressed.

With a budget of 270 million dollar you can still make rubbish. How come other small budget movies succeed (and they use CGI as well)? How come transformers have human faces? It is really frustrating to look at, especially with all the CGI, you know that they could have change this.

Michael Bay is able but maybe doesn't really want to make good movies? 13 Hours was nice but this have been a crime. I wonder how much they paid Mark or sir Anthony to be in this horrifying thing they call a movie. Or maybe they didn't see it. I hope so, for their conscience.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,I don't like the transformers franchise but i've made an exception and watched this terrible movie .. 1.The Story is too weak .. 2.The acting by Mark Wahlberg is terrible .. 3.Anthony Hopkins is so annoying in this movie and i don't know why he took this role .. 4.The Movie is so messy u couldn't understand nearly all of it .. 5.I hope this is the last transformers movie they'll make,1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I just loved Age of Extinction and expected this one is gonna be better. But guess what, The Last Knight is just a piece of crap. I watched it and at the end of the movie I thought, what the hell was that. I wasted my money and time for this crap movie. I wanted more of Optimus Prime but I saw more of a bloody teenage girl (Absolutely unnecessary) and bloody humans. Not a SINGLE real fight scene just human crap. We don't give a damn about humans when we watch Transformers movies. Michael Bay, if you are bored directing Transformers series..just give a chance to someone better. Absolutely crap movie. Not worth a sh**.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I have enjoyed the transformer series from the beginning and this is one of those movie I waited so eagerly to watch. But it was a disappointment. I don't know why but I felt the movie had nothing new to offer. Few things I thought were awful: 1. Same old way of directing, same camera shots, even though I enjoy these shots a lot, this time they seem very vague. I don't know if it was the director or cinematographer. 2. Bad story line, very depressing screenplay and most importantly terrible editing. 3. I need to emphasize on editing because it seemed like a patch work. 4. MOST IMPORTANTLY NOTHING NEW TO BE OFFERED BY THE MOVIE. If they had a movie formula (Big fights, slow motion shots, huge explosions, a lot of CGI work, more action, few emotional dialogues ) for international market, this movie fits in well.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"What a terrible movie!! So for the first 30-45 minutes, director forcefully tries to introduce this new little ""nobody girl"" without any point. That sucks your interest out of the movie right at the beginning. Then comes a terrible sequencing of events with hard-to-focus 10 seconds of action every now and then.

Storyline has never been very good for Transformers' movies, but the action used to cover it all. This movie, however, has terrible action which makes it worst of all.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I just can't believe,that people who did these movies are trusted with hundreds of millions. The movie, doesn't have any logic, any acting, any anything, it's all stupid mumbo jumbo and CGI.

Making movies, supposed to be an art, but this is just teenagers trying to do a movie. I was really shocked, that this kind of garbage was allowed to reach the public.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Yeah, wow... Never have I have seen so little happen in so much time. Obviously these movies are about the special effects only anyway, but that said; I wish they stop with these sparkly rock concert 'explosions'. And it would also be nice if actors would 'respond' to the cg stuff happening around them. Mark; that was a 15 feet sword coming at your face and barely missing you, and you didn't even flinch. Obviously because it was never there, but isn't the point to at least pretend it was?",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Why does this movie even exists? WHY? I mean... WHY? We all know milking is bad, right? They are milking Star Wars since 1999. They are milking the Marvel heroes, DC heroes, you name it. One year ago, they started milking the Harry Potter universe. But why, OH WHY good sir, are they milking the Transformers! What's left to milk? I mean, in Star Wars or Marvel/DC, you have something to milk... there is content and they may be only pop corn movies but at the very least they are good pop corn movies. The Transformers franchise is as dry as the Sahara desert. Do you know why I choose Sahara for comparison? BECAUSE SAHARA MEANS DESERT IN ARABIC, THAT'S HOW DRY THIS FRANCHISE IS. It's desert squared.

.....

So, everyone is bored in this movie. EVERYONE (insert Gary Oldman meme from Leon the Professional).

Michael Bay is a F@$#% thief, alright? That's what he is. His only talent is to promote himself, f@ck him. He has no vision for the franchise he worked for 10 years!!! 10 F@$#% YEARS OF THE SAME SH!T! Dude, just retire! You don't care, that is obvious. You want money, OK that's great. You have money now, go retire. Why do you even bother? E-mail me and tell me why.

Mark Wahlberg's character (wait to IMDb him...) Cade Yeager is F@$#% boring. Wahlberg is bored, he is just collecting paychecks for his retirement. But the movie tells you ""HE IS IMPORTANT"" F@#$ NO! He is not! What else...? Oh of course there are robots in this movie... after all, it's called (wait to IMDb it...) Transformers: The Last Knight. Yeah, they exist and our ""lead"" (hahahaha) Optimus Prime is barely in the movie, but what did you expect? You want to see MARK ""GIVE ME YOUR MONEY"" WAHLBERG! That's why you are watching Transformers... F@@@@@@@@K!!!! Yes.. sorry about that. As I was saying, robots exists in the movie.. in the background. They do staff and they say things. By the way, Peter Cullen is also bored. His character is barely in the movie and when he is, Optimus sounds bored while the thing he said most of the time was ""I am Optimus Prime"" WE KNOW WHO HE IS!! It's the fifth movie and saying the same thing over and over and over again it doesn't make it epic, it makes it stupid. The movie is trying to compensate for the lack of Optimus by making every line of dialogue sound like an epic speech.

Who else is bored in this piece of SH!T? THE F@$#% EDITOR (IMDbing him/her...oh my god it's not just one...F@$#% ME) LOOK AT THIS SH!T: Roger Barton ... (edited by) Adam Gerstel ... (edited by) Debra Neil-Fisher ... (edited by) John Refoua ... (edited by) Mark Sanger ... (edited by) Calvin Wimmer ... (edited by) Seriously? Wow... Great Job Roger, Adam, Debra, John, Mark and Calvin... just great. I should have come to you to edit my student films. Never knew I could, but if I can go back in time I will.

Speaking of student films, this film has FOUR WRITERS!! What the F@$#%? FOUR WRITERS?? AND FOUR MINDS CAME UP WITH THE LAST KNIGHT??? Are we serious in this stupid planet? So... one incredible bad director, four writers, six editors and $217.000.000= Transformers: The Last Knight. In conclusion, if you want to commit suicide, DO NOT watch this movie. If nothing else, it will enforce your decision.

SPOILER TIME!!!!! The Last Knight is Cade Yeager... not Optimus or any other Transformer, but the useless, boring, human. Yeeeeeeah!!! F@ck you too!",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I would like to give you the true concept and update of the reviews of this movie.

Like almost all reviews that were written by sane people down here, this is by far one of the worst movies ever made!!! The other few reviews that say how awesome this movie was, were probably written by the producers or the cast themselves... LAME! There are so many mistakes and so many fast scenes that you can't catch up with. The entire movie looks like it was made by an amateur, except for the end...

In other words, DON'T EVEN BOTHER WATCHING IT!",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"This movie praises the spirit of the knights and promotes the spirit of the knights. But the logic of the film misses the spirit of pollution in the knights.

I do not know why the film style so much change, really do not know, in particular, the director did not change the case, there is such a big negative change.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Michael Bay went to the bathroom in his pants, therefore I came on IMDb to share my ambiguous ideas with everyone, in a facetious fashion. I can't write for crap so I came on IMDb to pretend I am a critic, I add a few words that make me seem more intelligent then I am, and I hit that magic preview button!! A large portion of my life is spent doing this. Thank you for reading!

Cordially: Someone who failed writing class and came on IMDb in hopes that my review would somehow give me gratification.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"This was probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. To be honest, i think Michael Bay is a terrible director and this film proves that. It is like they came up with the plot in five seconds and then focused on action and explosions. Even worse the entire film made no sense and why Anthony Hopkins signed up for this bull crap i don't know. This film basically made no sense, had major plot holes and the actions scenes didn't make up for this failure of a movie. I even think that this film was worse than Birdemic when i come to think about it, and trust me that was a bad film. I would recommend that you don't waste your money on this piece of SH*T. I did and i'll regret it for the rest of my life.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"As a big Transformers fan, i liked the 1st Transformers movie a lot, despite the weird looking transformers (comparing to the animation series), and the humor/jokes in it.

Then the movies got worse and worse. This new Transformers movie, just make me stop watching this series. Its the first time i switched off a transformers movie. Acting is bad, jokes are bad, story is very very bad. I think Michael bay targeted this movie for young children/teenagers, because the story is so cheesy, like he didn't had time to create a story, but just made something up while shooting this film.

Megatron died like 3 times in the series, and now is back again without any story behind it. He just shows up as the semi bad guy.

Also the little girl and her toyrobot, are very bad characters without any story behind them. The movie would be better if they deleted them from the movie.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"It's kind of painful because the 4&5 movies are interesting conceptually. I dug the concepts like human made transformers, the transformers actually being a slave class and the idea that humans would obviously come to fear and outlaw them. That never seems to be the issue with transformer movies. It's always the pacing and dialog. I watch a lot of Korean and Asian cinema generally and the dialog whether it be subtitled or dubbed is always at least a little confusing. Thats one of the hallmarks of a good film. That the scenes can convey the message well enough that you can sort out the dialog. This movie is the opposite end of the spectrum. The pacing, establishing shots and dialog are so bad I was constantly confused about what was going on. Transformers from all over the galaxy are crash-landing on earth at a rate so high they have forces dedicating to killing them on impact rather than trying to sort out good guys and bad guys. Neat. Cade has creating a haven for good ones. Neat. They're hiding out from the government, Then it all falls apart. Megatron has hostages and trades them for the freedom over the lamest possible decepticons. the task force decides to let them know where cade is so that can trap the decepticons. So they know where Cade is, have been ignoring him, but instead of warning him they show up later? and ignore the decpticons and attack cade? what? They fight off the decepticons then the task force and anthony hopkins shows up something something england prophesy, oh also Optimus thinks the makers hurt cybertron even though he blew it up in the 3rd movie and there's this obnoxious British model whos supposed to be a professor but she sucks...look I know what you're thinking ""man this review is just meandering and rambling."". Actually I'm trying to give you a sense of the confusing nonsensical plot of this movie. Also I literally fell asleep during the england prophesy stuff. I will genuinely try and rewatch it, but I really gotta admit. This may actually be the worst Transformers movie. It's dull and difficult to watch.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I have enjoyed the transformers franchise but this one here did it no justice at all. Where was the storyline, where was the plot? No backgrounds for some characters, some characters just coming out of nowhere. Optimus Prime's part in this movie was disappointing. The talents in the cast such as Anthony Hopkins not utilized at all. What happened here? Not too pleased in spending my money to stream this through Amazon Video.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I was expecting it to be weak, but man this totally destroyed my will to live, I would rate it at -10 if I could.

This is the first time I felt the need to write a review about a movie. I do not recommend anybody watching this, it shouldn't have more than one star, for the following reasons:

1. Script: doesn't seem to exist, there are a lot of things that simply don't make sense, even after taking into account the sci-fi aspect. 2. Horrible camera action. 3. Scenes abruptly change, nothing connects, no transitions. 4. Disastrous acting. 5. Defies logic, in a bad way.

Overall, surprisingly bad movie, even if you expect it to be bad.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Somewhere in this movie is a good story. But thanks to awful direction, that good story is buried in a jumbled, un-entertaining mess.

For the most part, nobody speaks in this movie. They banter. They deliver rapid fire one liners, quips, rather than lines. Crescendo becomes meaningless if everything is a crescendo. Quips, one liners, funny moments become cumbersome when every moment is filled with ironu and poor attempts at humor.

There's a young girl character called something with a z. I can't remember the name. But the actress is awful. She doesn't speak her banter, she poses it. Even when she stands still, she does it in a deliberate way. Everything from her is forced, unnatural.

There are flashbacks and even flashbacks within flashbacks, so it's hard to keep track of an ongoing story. Bay, as usual, makes use of too much slow motion. In one scene, one of the Transformers fires a time slowing weapon. But the effect is lost because it blends into all the other slow motion action. Some people caught in the weapon's range are moving slowly, but everyone moves slowly when there's action. So, um, what's happening?

A lot of the effects look like something out of a theme park attraction. There are lots of explosions, bullets ricocheting, and sparks, but nothing seems close to the people who are the targets of the massive fire power. Once in awhile the action goes to super slow motion (that's why the slo mo weapon is confusing) as something barely misses a ducking and dodging human who shouldn't be capable of moving fast enough to get out of the way.

Transformers roll around, losing pieces of their bodies. The action is shown with an always moving camera, with time jumps, and zoomed in to the point it's impossible to tell how the fight is progressing. Are all those pieces flying off a giant robot important? Is the robot winning or losing the fight? Did that part fly off before now, or is now a flashback, or is it a time jump? Is a robot hurt? Who knows?

Speaking of time jumps, Bay loves to approach a scene then jump past the beginning, into the middle of the action. Someone is walking out of a building, a car approaches, then suddenly the person is inside the car in the middle of a chase scene. There's a lack of continuity. It's hard for a viewer to get his bearings, and thus it's hard to enjoy the scene. WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!!???? It doesn't help that the minds behind this movie pasted Transformers on top of King Arthur.

The whole movie feels rushed, or feels like it has too much cut out of it. Bay makes action in a disjointed way, and the overall movie is delivered in a disjointed way.

It's hard to watch and even harder to like.

Michael Bay makes the song a complicated mess.

Transformers! More than meets the eye. Transformers! Robots in disguise. Transformers!

Autobots wage their battle To destroy the evil forces Of the Decepticons

Transformers!

Autobots are King Arthur's Knights And an evil queen Wants to destroy the Earth But it's called Unicron And there's a chosen one With a moving talisman But there's another chosen one Who wields Merlin's staff It was given to him By the Autobots",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"There is no doubt that any movie of this franchise is never going to be a great one. We always expect it to be bad but with some enjoyable action sequences. But this particular one was a big surprise. It surpassed all my expectation of being a pointless movie and turned out to be one of the worst I've ever seen.

Firstly, how horrible the plot is!! This shows how hard they are trying to just push out a new film to make money. The story was annoying and ridiculous. Prime goes bad and then suddenly good, BIG SURPRISE!! How is the lead actors not dead after those falls and even being at close proximity of the fights between the transformers! This movie didn't care about logic at any single moment.

Secondly, Michael Bay makes bad films but he makes very good action sequences. Its hard not to enjoy those. But in this film, that one thing he does best was absent.

Moreover, there is an inevitable thing called 'PHYSICS'. If that planet came that close to earth, we would have massive floods all over the world. I know its an idiotic movie but shouldn't this be addressed in at least some small level!

Even with very low expectations I got disappointed, thats how bad this movie is!! I think the studios should stop spending any more money on this horrible franchise.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"yeap, the worst junk of all... frankly, i'm really a lazy person, too lazy even to leave a comment. But somehow, this film really is that bad until i really force myself to leave a comment here!!!

after the witwicky boy's blabla winny whinny is gone, now replace with a black guy whose i don't even care to remember the name but which bring the same effect => really annoying and the jokes are so off. No offense, but is not about the actor, it's just either a bad script or a bad director? everything is so loosely connected... is like a car blown into tiny fragments and scattered all around the world!!!

ps: I do rather spent 2 hours watching my cat having its nap with a pot of tea!",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I rarely am motivated to write reviews- only when they are really good, or really bad. My husband wanted to see this, so we rented it. I did not expect to love it, but I thought I could sit with him and pay marginal attention at least. I was wrong. I very much enjoy special effects. I love high action. But when the movie is composed entirely of exploding, machine blowing up, fire, bombs, guns, and screaming/yelling of all dialogue, I quickly become shell shocked and need to get away. I ended up retreating as far as possible to get away from the NOISE, that is this movie. It was literally giving me a headache. As for plot? I cannot combine in any way in my head, that makes sense, Lancelot, Merlin, and the Knights of the Round Table, with Transformer robots. The plot(?loosely used) jumped around so much it made no sense, and felt like random bit pieces tossed in to try to add some story to the explosions. The acting was so underdone I didn't even care about actors I normally like, like Anthony Hopkins. Mark Wahlburg has never been an outstanding actor in my opinion; in this, he seems to try even less. Of course, there is not much to work with. I suppose the audience is more geared to teenage boys wanting to simply see action and special effects. If that is all you want, go for it- but you might want to watch it on mute.",1
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Well, I have been watching movies in cinemas a lot in last ten years. And I have never slept in any movie. But THANK YOU Micheal BAY! for this honor. Hats off, never had such a deep sleep in my life. Avoid it, if you can. If someone is willing to pay for your ticket, pay them double to get out of this situation.

Lastly, thank you to Micheal Bay for motivating me enough to write my first ever IMDb review.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Ignore all the good reviews. You'll see most are posted on the same date and probably fishy. This is one of the worse movies ever made. Comparable to the ScyFy movies that air on the weekends. Movies like Sharknado and Crocasaurus. Actually, these movies may be better than Transformers: The Last Knight.

How hard is it to follow the storyline of the old cartoons? Make a live action movie out of Transformers: The Movie. Instead they give us this pool of incoherent dribble. Transformers and the knights of the round table? C'mon what a silly storyline. Human macho-ism check. Evil Optimus Prime who reverts back to good from the sound of Bumblebee's voice? Trash. Crappy jokes are plenty in this film. It then ends with a spoiler about the next film and it's going to be even worse than this!",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"The fifth Transformer Movie has been made, similar to the Pirates hitting their fifth movie earlier this year. Unlike Dead Men Tell No Tales, which was surprisingly decent considering the series' track record, The Last Knight decided to opt for making the same stupid mistakes as its predecessors.

I think it says a hell of a lot when The Nostalgia Critic himself made a video predicting the plot for this film a full week before it launched. And it says even more that, for the most part, he was right. ""So is Optimus Prime now a villain, destroying years of hero worship in the ultimate franchise gamble? Yes, yes he is, and Mickey Mouse is officially a terrorist. Of course that's not what happens!"" - Nostalgia Critic.

This film is even worse than he predicted. Even Michael Bay, for all his failings, knew in his previous films not to screw with the aspect ratio. In this film, the aspect ratio is changed EVERY OTHER SHOT. It goes from fullscreen to large distracting black bars on the top and bottom to slightly smaller black bars and back to fullscreen, rinse and repeat for the two and a half hours you sit in the theater, or shorter if you have the sensibility to leave before it ends... oh wait, IT NEVER ENDS. They even sequel bait at the end of it like a Marvel movie!

This serious technical problem would be fine if it were the only thing wrong, but oh boy, it gets worse. The story is nonexistent. Everyone does and says stupid things all the time. The characters are cardboard cutouts that scream loudly at everything. They use Stonehenge as a final battleground and turn the watch that killed Hitler into a plot device. They say that Steven Hawking knows about the Transformers. We never see him show up (but to be honest it would be incredible if his wheelchair turned into a Transformer. It would be so incredibly dumb but everyone would love it.) Not just Steven Hawking, but every historical figure you've probably heard about somewhere knew about the Transformers and was part of, basically, a secret club dedicated to covering it up. There's a robot that is mentioned midway through to be a C3PO ripoff. He leans more toward K2SO ripoff, so it's a worse sin in my book. The French robot (HERGG RERGG as they call him because of his stereotypical French accent) shouts out ""I'll stop the time!"" every time he shoots his gun, like a DBZ character without any character.

That wall of text might seem extremely bad, BUT IT GETS WORSE STILL. Optimus Prime, now known as Nemesis Prime, is in the movie... for 2 minutes. He fights Bumblebee (who is even given a backstory involving Nazis for maybe 1 minute... geez what's with the obsession with WWII?), which was teased in practically every trailer... for 2 minutes. Then he goes back to being Optimus. The main bad girl exists solely to sequel bait. Instead of making the military look like idiots, Bay turns to making a top mind at NASA look like an idiot for trying to save the world using science and physics. Way to f*cking go...

This movie is a failure on basically every level. If you haven't seen it yet I envy you, and please don't go do so. If you have... pray to God they don't make a Transformers 6. Pray to God they scrap the sequel bait and leave the Transformers alone for a while. Maybe one day we'll get a good Transformers movie, similar to the first. But for now... it's just a pile of scrap.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It is clear that even director was bored with the franchise and ran out of creative thoughts.

This 2.5 hour train wreck only has 1 hour of real material and they've tried to inflate to the full length by filling the time with an extraordinarily amount of long, drawn out shots, flash backs and dead narrative.

Next to that, or maybe as a result, for the first 90 minutes, their was an utter lack of progress and clarity of story. I was so utterly bored.

Please let this be the last one.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"To sum it up: In the super hero genre this would be the equivalent of the Green Lantern with the X-Men Origins: Wolverine version of Deadpool playing almost every character. You've got Ryan Reynolds and plenty of budget yet you're left banging your head against the wall because it isn't Deadpool or Logan and it should be.

Possible plot spoilers.

If you have seen one Transformers movie, you have seen them all. Transformers molded the history of Earth and humanity, insert mcguffin, lengthy dialogue that serves no purpose other than to explain the poorly conceived plot to the audience, forced and awkward sexual jokes/innuendos, Optimus Prime repeating his name and giving numerous soliloquies, horrible adaptations of legacy transformers, and characters with 0 development.

The 5th installment literally repeats the story of the first 4 almost verbatim while at the same time contradicting everything we have seen before and offering nothing new aside from new explosions and special effects. No one expects an Academy Award for Best Picture out of this franchise but given the amount of talent in the cast and the size of the budget it's frustrating that we can't at least get some resemblance of a new story. Unfortunately at this stage even the visual effects cannot save it or even distract you from the frustrating parts of this franchise.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"i gave 2stars just for : i)good graphic work, ii) good cast. otherwise everything seemed to being pushed , as if there was no proper script and still the movie was made. Too many unnecessary characters were involved who would simply add few minutes to the movie , unnecessary try to put some ""funny(comedy) sequence"". Among many things that raise my level of dislike ,one thing that i could not accept is-- how did Bumble bee evolve into an autobot who could detach its all body parts and join again at its own will? (last time of transformer1 i remember bumble bee had a broken leg and was being dragged by a towing truck driven by megan fox). One more event I couldn't understand is -- how does 'cade yeager' find an alien assault rifle of man size (as transformers are way bigger that human) not only he uses a rifle from previous movie, here he has a man sized alien hand-gun (pistol like)! Anyways it can be watched once just to continue the series (although i could not bear with same old action plot and had to forward scenes often).",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I dunno what to say about TLK, it is so bad that it is irritating, M.Bay ruined a potenital good idea for a movie with all his bull...t and most of the crew piled on behind him. Only things that were easier to suffer are CGI and A.Hopkins ( for the life of me I can not fathom why he said yes, I mean the check must be huge) everything else made me cringe and just rooting for the movie to be over. Do not expect anything from the movie it will deliver just that. Enjoy!",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"1* given to the production 1* given to my 2hrs time

Seriously? Lame jokes, awful dialogues. Awful acting. Awful follow ups. I have no idea what am I watching for the past two hours until the magic staff. Come on we don't have to study the whole 3 quarter of the movie history to know what the staff capable of. I pity megatron. He and OP battle always last less than 5 seconds and never win. Bringing back old casts is just ashame. Story is trying too hard on making sense but just too awful boring. Characters development failed. Thank god for those who didn't spend their money in the cinema.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I would give this piece of cr*p a zero but these two points go to the team that was working on CGI in this movie.

What a waste of money and time, I cannot believe that I spent almost 3 hours watching this BS.

I would rather drown myself then actually watch this thing again. This whole Transformers franchise was a complete fail. And If someone makes a remake 5-10 years from now, guided by this bad experience, I would probably watch the grass grow rather.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"First off, if you want the BEST Transformers movie, watch the 1980's cartoon one. Sure, it has the 80's music and some cartoon editing issues, but at least it is coherent.

As for this ""Last"" installment. I will compare the ""series"" to going partying for a night & All I can say is:

The Transformer movie series begins with the best intentions of having a good time and enjoying ones self in guilty pleasures. The evening starts out very well. After a couple of cocktails and laughs everyone is having a good time and enjoying themselves, wondering with anticipation what will be next.

Following that, the night continues and the mind becomes a bit overwhelmed. There is more going on, new things to see and twists and turns that can be taken with a bit of awe and excitement.

As the night continues and the partying and cocktails flow, things begin to become somewhat confused. Perspective changes and what perhaps once made sense, is now somewhat confusing. Things tend to start looking out of place and questions about what is going on begin to emerge.

By the end of the knight, all bets are off. The mind is now completely overwhelmed, just trying to make sense out of what is going on. Words becomes muddled and senses dulled, sound and light become cacophonous, actions questionable. Cohesion to any semblance of what once was is gone and dialogue seems strained at best. At this point the world becomes a tapestry of confusion and nonsense. One forgets why they went out in the first place and what the point of the evening was. The best thing one can do is go home, take a few aspirin and hope the headache goes away.

At least, this was my take.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Scenario was so bad that I almost got a cancer. Big stars, big budget but all we got is an unclear story about some transformers origins and next big enemy to fight. Movie lost my attention in the 2nd minute when unknown character (little girl) was crying about unknown transformer to make audience emotional.. meh",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I'm a huge transformers fan but what on earth happened to this movie? I'm not even going to explain myself with this rubbish movie. I'm so disappointed. If you're a fan of the movie, you will most likely be disappointed. I don't recommend anyone to watch this junk. Also, The duration of the film felt like it lasted a damn lifetime. Again, so disappointed. It's so bad, i had to write a review!",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"However, it is only a very thin disguise.

No attempt has been made in this movie to give it even the flimsiest of coherent story lines. Knights, Nazis and some serious butchery of the Transformers nature all combine to make a movie that is nothing more than noise and light.

Of course, no one really expects there to be much of a story. The Transformers movies have always been about Michael Bay's over-indulgence of his own fantasies rather than making a decent movie. Action is the best you can expect from these, but here, there isn't even the feeblest of pretences of trying to make anything more.

Bay's trademarks of mindless action, combined with the truly bizarre (and downright borderline racist) ethnicity foisted on the Transformers combine to make a thoroughly disagreeable viewing experience. Remember when George Lucas was roundly (and rightly) condemned for Jar Jar Binks thinly veiled Uncle Tom routine? Yet somehow Bay gets away with almost the same sort of crap with every Transformers movie.

You can't really expect much of a supposed grown man who names his favourite camera the ""Bayhem"", I suppose.

More so than the previous franchise movies, this one tries for a considerable amount of comic levity. However (I'm using that word a lot here) the humour is extremely forced and lame and falls flat most of the time. It is as if the only exposure to comedy that the writer had was watching Three stooges re-runs and listening to the playground jokes of small, immature, children. There are a LOT of Transformer pratfalls, racially suspect humour and sexual innuendo that leave you in no doubt that Bay is involved.

Perhaps most insulting, though, is the attempt about an hour or so in to convince the viewer that the Transformers have been on Earth throughout human history since the times of King Arthur. It is a lamentable choice that seems as shoehorned in as it sounds. A feeble pretext that serves as an excuse for more Bay action nonsense that is never referenced at all before in the franchise. Bay retconning his own nonsense.

All in all, the movie is an exercise in endurance that never rewards its viewer's time investment. It is beyond shallow, with a tonal dissonance that makes you constantly frown at what you are seeing. It paints a scene of the world at peril that it constantly undermines with its clownish buffoonery. In short, it is all over the place.

Speaking of all over the place...Mark Wahlberg here looks almost as befuddled as he did in The Happening. Since it seems that this franchise is the highlight of his career, you can't blame him for continuing to do these movies.

As for what Anthony Hopkins is doing in this turkey, I have no idea. I hope he was recompensed adequately for his time. Perhaps Bay hoped his presence would add a measure of gravitas to the film. If so, then Bay sure went out of his way to ruin that with everything else.

SUMMARY: Complete nonsense. A story that Looney Tunes wouldn't even entertain. Humour straight from Bay's inner eight-year old. Essentially Michael Bay discovering his ""excess"" knob went up to 11. A big pile of nothing that is embarrassing to watch. Avoid.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"A few years ago, after the Shia LaBeouf-starring Transformers trilogy came to a close with Dark of the Moon, Michael Bay made the welcome announcement that he was to leave the franchise he'd been working on day-in day-out for the past 5 years, causing critics - and film buffs forcing themselves to endure such cinematic waste - to rejoice in the process. This, of course, wasn't true, as he came back to the series to helm Age of Extinction in 2014, this time starring the considerably buffer frame of Mark Wahlberg. I don't remember much of what happened - other than incoherent special effects bashing each other and blowing things up - but there was certainly no extinction, and whatever happened in that film inspired Bay to explore new stories in the Transformers universe. And so here we are with number five - The Last Knight.

He's tricked us before into believing that we were finally moving into a world free of Bay's Transformers movies, so there's no reason to believe his new claims that The Last Knight will indeed be his last foray into the stories of the Autobots and Decepticons (although its always been much more about the humans). There's a Bumblebee spin- off starring Hailee Steinfeld already shooting, and the climax here certainly leads us to believe that there's even more to come. The Last Knight runs at a whopping 149 minutes (which is actually one of the shortest in the series), and every one of those minutes feels like a lifetime as Bay amps up everything the majority of people have come to hate about the franchise. Huge planets are smashed into each other, characters share awkward and painfully unfunny banter, and the camera leers so much at the franchise's latest hotty (a professor who dresses like a stripper played by Laura Haddock) that you almost long for the acting talents of Megan Fox.

Wahlberg returns as Cade Yeager, the inventor-turned-outlaw who still hasn't realised how ridiculous his name is, and now sports an equally ridiculous haircut. Following the events of the previous film, all Transformers have now been declared criminals, and the Transformer Reaction Force has been set up to eradicate the alien robots. Only more are arriving on Earth every day, so Optimus Prime has travelled back to his home planet to confront his maker for answers. Yeager is protecting many of the surviving Autobots at his junk yard, but soon finds himself caught up in events when a strange alien talisman attaches itself to his arm from the ship of a dead Transformer. Giant horns have emerged from the ground in various locations throughout the world, and it all somehow ties into a tale going back to the time of King Arthur and Merlin (the latter played by a game Stanley Tucci). Decepticons want the talisman for some reason, and by this time I'd given up.

The first hour is spent trying to explain the plot to the audience, while the rest is spent exploring aimless sub-plots, one involving a tough orphan child living in the ruins of a previous battle, designed to appeal to the young crowd. Within the first twenty minutes, it shamelessly rips-off Game of Thrones and Stranger Things, TV shows of a quality Bay could only dream of creating. By the time Anthony Hopkins shows up to collect his pay cheque, you'll be too worn out to tolerate his bumbling, exposition-tool shtick. Bay isn't interested in correcting the mistakes he has been criticised for in the past: The Last Knight is custom-made to appease the audience who willingly pay to see this migraine-inducing nonsense every couple of years. Yet judging for the film's rather uninspiring box-office take, even they are getting tired of it. With the exception of 2007's sporadically enjoyable first film, this franchise has left me angry, outraged, depressed and physically sick, but never had I felt indifferent. The Last Knight left me feeling nothing at all, other than incredibly sleepy.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Let me get this straight, Transformers 5, surprise they made a 5th sequel with now featuring King Arthur in the scene. Once again robots are invading as fast as possible with now a space aspect, and what's this? Our main hero has turned to the dark side? An interesting twist? Or just a gimmick?

With the new movie starring Mark Wahlberg and Laura Haddock as the main stars of the show with Shia Labeouf not being around to enjoy the battle. As Mark plays the man of the show in this film portraying as your typical father figure. In addition with Laura Haddock as the Megan Fox on this new sequel which I would say she played a better character, with adding more intelligence and reasoning to the plot rather than going it with the flow.

Now moving, what did the film did best and what did they do wrong? Well there's some to uncover. Starting off with the dialogue in the film where I would say it was too sloppy and simple with lack of depth, similar to how a elementary student would write. Next was how the story goes. Now it goes very fast like super quick in the first half which would lead to audiences being confused in the middle to understand what was even going on in the film. Lastly, additions to the drawbacks of the film would be about the CG and the cinematography of the film which seems like Michael was putting less effort every sequel with camera shots being too shaky and disturbing, less lighting on the main objects the movie was trying to focus on and the low quality CG he has did where I would admit he did a better job in the previous films.

Now this movie was shot in IMAX as Michael has stated. Thinking of it seems cool right? Seeing a full movie being shot at its full potential? Well no, the mistake I would say he did was he mixed both regular shots with IMAX shots which most of the time changes the sizes of the screen as well as the quality of the images which was quite disturbing and distracting.

Either way, the movie did have it's ups too. With now introducing a new plot with now focusing more on the planets rather than the robots themselves. With the addition of the new team with more diverse characters I see. And with every great action movie comes a great climactic battle scene.

In conclusion, in my opinion, overall the total movie was a complete waste of time and money, but to the hard core transformers fans, Michael Bay fan boys or just couple of kids who thinks robots are cool. I'm not recommending it but it's worth for some good family laughs together.

The movie was out on cinemas in 21 June, 2017 (USA)",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Transformers: The Last Knight is not very good. The movie is basically three hours of plot holes, fancy-looking scenery, little-to-no character development and, believe it or not, underwhelming action sequences.

I can't believe I'm saying this but even the action sequences felt boring and drawn out. These sequences use to be exciting, jaw-dropping and pure eye-candy all around. What happened? The action sequences were breathtaking in the previous four films - but The Last Knight completely fails to recapture the same magic of the original or even it's sequels.

There are so many plot holes as well but I won't get into heavy detail because that would make this review an entire book, but I will say this: There are various things that have changed from the previous movies to this one - with no explanation whatsoever! Over all, it's as if there was no motivation to even make this movie ""good"". I'm surprised Michael Bay even attached his name to this movie.

If Paramount is reading: Bring back Shia and maybe even Megan. Improve the action sequences. Develop a cinematic universe. Find ways to get audiences excited again.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"This is the WORST experience I have ever had in a theater, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely up there.

Transformers: The Last Knight,"This movie was beyong terrible. It just didn't seem likethey decided what kind of movie they wanted it to be whether a gigantic robot death match, rom-com, etc. That caused the plot didn't make a lot of sense. In this installment I felt that Michawl Bay, the director, tried to do too much all at the same time. He tried to combine humor with romance with huge fighting robots and the result is a mess. The talent of many of the actors and actresses were wasted as well and most of them should've either never been cast or should've had a different role in my opinion. While I like Wahlberg I don't think he ever should've been cast in this movie, frankly I don't think he has the talent or charisma to pull it off. The talent of actors like Anthony Hopkins was wasted. While I like Jerrod Carmichael, he never should've been cast in this movie either, he was just funny at the wrong times. The humanoid robot thing in the movie also shouldn't have been included, I thought he was simply just awkward. Overall, I think they should've done a better job of tying this film to the Transformers comic books and TV shows, creating a plot that you could follow along and actually casts actors and actresses that have a reputation for carrying their own movies and have enough talent to play their roles correctly. I also think that if they actually based this movie off of a well-known Transformers story arc it would've been better. Those of us that were fans of the TV shows as well as the comics were thrown off by the way they tried to tie this into the greater Tranformers universe because it didn't make any sense and wasn't developed enough throughout the movie anyway.",2

So agonizingly slow paced that it's like watching what nails on a chalkboard sounds like, and the acting by the people is just horrible. Hopefully Bumblebee will be better.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"If you're like me and just want to see some robots kick ass, you may be able to stomach just how absolutely garbage this movie is.

Absolutely everything except the CGI is utter trash, waste of human resources, garbage amateur movie.

It has no consistency, characters just disappear from scenes and come back later just because.

Acting is poor at best, same unstable personalities, except now it's not from a teenager, these are adult characters.

I don't know how Anthony Hopkins ended up in here, I hope he at least enjoyed himself acting in the movie more than I did watching this atrocity.

So yeah, watch it for the transformers, if you can.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Could well be the worst movie I've ever seen. It's an incoherent mess filled with random explosions, slow motion shots that add less than zero to the movie silly dramatic shots of Mark Wahlberg that are beyond cringeworthy.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"The action was gook, the concept was passable, but the script was horrific! Why? It would be great if they stop choosing writes for some 'I owe somebody a favor and have to hire his nephew with no skill' pool! What a silly, poorly written script. Even the same concept, in the hands of a skilled writer, could have tuned out differently, however what they delivered was a hot mess.

I don't know why people with so much money, can't tell a bad script, still. It should not be this hit and miss at this point in the game. This was a miss, with a whole lot of expensive actors and effects, and all that went with that. So sad.",2
Transformers: The Last Knight,"So let's continue the review of films based on cartoons Now it's Transformers' turn The Last Knight released in 2017 I've always liked the Transformers saga Because all the people say it's not a good saga at all but this film was the only film which for me is not meI didn't like it at all. I really didn't like this film at all. I think it's the worst of the saga so why this time things have gotten much worse in this film and I warn you that in this review everything will contain spoilers. So let's say the only positive thing about this film. They are theCGI effects this is really the only positive thing about this film For the rest it's all negative So the human characters are really all stereotypes all the human characters but the thing that doesn't really make sense So in the previous film I really liked it that is not therelet's say the military in the first film. I didn't mind them because they were important but with the sequels and I'm not too knowledgeable they didn't realize that the weapons don't work with the robots but afterwards in that film they weren't there at all. But then you can know why in this film I'm still therethe military Michael Bay you really screwed up But then returning to Michael Bay in this film The direction is really bad but in this film Yes because Michael Bay's direction doesn't work at all because every scene There is always a different editing always every scene every minute you don'tcan follow a film in this way then in this film we don't see much of the robot and this film is also called Transformers they make very little appearance especially Optimus Prime but really then here suddenly a character appears who had really disappeared until the third film i.e. AgentSimmons But why does she suddenly appear then I didn't like Quintessa because I consider her the worst villain in the saga of all and then she doesn't really do almost anything for the whole film but now we start the things that don't really make sense at all i.e. So inconsistencies in the filmin the original they said that the Transformers didn't land on earth in the era when the first machines were invented but in this film they say that they landed in the folder in the King Artun era and then this is just something that doesn't make sense to everyone when Megatron appears But sorryin the previous film he had become gabatron And why here he returns to being Megatron it's as if the director, screenplay and producers created this film without first seeing the previous ones because I have no other explanations one thing I want to mention when there is a clash between bumblebee isOptimus Prime when he says it's me But sorry but he hadn't removed the vowel before like Impossible how can he speak then This film was really a disappointment because because the other four who I saw I didn't like it but I didn't like this Fifth it really makes sense and then it goes aheadthe things of the previous films I say this time if I always said that I recommend these films but take this Fifth one because it is not at all good to watch please avoid it to conclude rating 3+",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I haven't seen a Transformers movie in a pretty long time, so I honestly didn't know what to expect going into this film. But I can tell you that this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. I literally fell asleep in the theater because my mind just gave up.

First and foremost......... the editing...

I've never seen a high-budget motion picture edited this badly before, and that's the main aspect that made it virtually unwatchable. I don't know if the same thing happens in the IMAX or 3D versions of the film, but whenever the movie cuts between different shots in a scene, you can notice some shots have a vertical letterbox while others don't. Whoever worked on the editing didn't bother to check that all the raw footage was exported in the same aspect ratio. So what you get is some shots that are in regular widescreen (16:9), other shots that have a slight vertical letterbox, and then a 3rd group of shots that have a much more apparent vertical letterbox. Seriously-- I've never seen something so ridiculous in my life. And this anomaly occurs throughout the ENTIRE 2 HOURS of the film. Visually, it's really distracting and I have to force my eyes to concentrate on what's going on in the scene. I can only hope that the filmmakers noticed this already and are now working to re-edit everything so it looks correct for the Digital/Blu-ray releases.

The second problem with the editing is that the pacing is really bad. I don't know how to explain it exactly, but the best way I can describe it is, it feels like I'm watching a 2-and-a-half hour trailer for an action movie. Every scene feels extremely rushed, the camera angles change all the time, and it not only makes it hard to follow the story, but it kills the mood of some scenes where you're supposed to connect with the characters. It's really bad.

Let me finish off this review with the best aspects of the film, and why I gave it a 3 instead of a 1.

To begin with, the acting in this film was rather good. I personally really liked the actress that played Izabella; she did a great job and was very believable.

The script/dialogue was pretty good too. There were a couple jokes in the film where I was able to laugh.

The best part of the film for me was definitely the CG. Visually, the movie looks AMAZING. There is so much detail in the transformers themselves, and when they change into cars the transitions are flawless.

Unfortunately due to the horrific nature of the editing, the good aspects of the film can easily go unnoticed.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Michael Bay and Transformers, you know the names but know that these two don't mix together. This 5th and supposedly final installment of the film series does what it's previous films does best; recycle itself and be more garbage than it was. With a storyline that had potential but delivered incoherently, cheesy one liners that felt forced and choppy editing, camera work and loud sounds that would make you go deaf or even numbers by the end.

The acting ranges between so-so to annoying, Mark Wahlberg is again at this weakest with this confused character trait from AOE, I have seen him in better films where he can expand more and be a real action man on screen. Josh Duhamel returns in a good performance that doesn't give him much to do, Laura Haddock is the 2nd best actress in the film and the series itself, having beauty and acting chops she had mix well together while the worst and annoying cast member was Isabela Moner, who was pretty much miscast for the film.

There a few good things about this though: Anthony Hopkins making the best of his character, trying to explain the 'significance' of the story while getting a few laughs out along the way, the visual effects are at top notch as with the previous films and the finale that obviously leaves the door open for more films (though Bay and Wahlberg have said they are done with the series). Overall, The Last Knight is definitely a disappointment but only slightly better than Age of Extinction in terms of the final action set piece scale. With only some good comedy moments from Hopkins and the decent CGI effects from Industrial Light and Magic, this film feels like its wasted 2 and 1/2 hours (maybe longer) of precious time that I could spent elsewhere. Just hope that now Bay doesn't come anywhere near the MCU and the DCEU franchises.

1.5/5 - Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Transformer:The Last Knight is worst film of the year. Why they didn't keep it sweet and simple like Transformer 2007? The Last Knight is ugly mix of everything. Too much of history, kids, Anthony Hopkins that all seemed misfit and make the film unnecessarily lengthy.I kept falling sleep and only wake up when the noise got really louder. I have to admit that graphic effect and quality was good. It could be a film of the year if it is all about transformer and simple story line.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Giving this film a 3 out of 10 is an extended grace on my part. In truth, I don't hate the ""Transformers"" series, especially since the first one was decent enough and actually quite fun to watch. But progressively, they've turned into a crapfest of wasted CGI, and this one takes the cake.

A waste of 217+ million dollars worth of CGI. At the end of it all, the only thing that you will ever remember about it is the nonstop explosion of cars, Optimus Prime saying ""This is my home!"" and ""I am Optimus Prime!"", and Megatron hissing ""Optimus!""

...That's about it. Really. I finished the film less than half an hour ago since I've written this review, and I've already forgotten what the movie was about. If you want exploding cars and robots, go for it. Otherwise, you'll be wasting almost three hours of your life, and this is time that you'll never get back.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,The movie was enjoyable but fans of the original Transformers would be having trouble trying to enjoy the movie since it is full of plot holes and disrespected the source material. The action was enough to distract the normal viewers but fans could tell all from the biggest to the tiniest detail that the movie got wrong. The movie also looked like Michael Bay used only the cover of the comic or the cover of the VHS tape as source material. Bay tried to fix the movie by bringing many characters from the Gen 1 series but ended up either wasting them or disrespecting the character. The only thing they got right was Optimus Prime was a Badass.,3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Usually when someone asks ""What happens in the movie?"" or ""What's it about?"" you can give the person a consistent answer. Not the case with The Last Knight. Coming out of the theater if you asked me what the movie was about I couldn't really tell you what happened because nothing really did. Characters are introduced and then five minutes later disappear, probably because there is more side characters than extras in the film. A lot of things appear and then disappear as well, I distinctly remember a scene where a truck hits a transformer, there's a small explosion and the truck disappears. There's also a lot of random cuts where things just sort of happen and there's a lack of visual continuity. But all that aside this is a movie about robots fighting, and that's what you pay for, except that's not what you get. There's about 20 minutes of transformers action in the entire film and Optimus Prime gets less than 15 minutes of screen time. If you want to see transformers fighting watch one of the older movies.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Never ever have I yawned this much within 150 minutes...

This movie didn't make sense one bit, it felt like I was watching an alternative history movie with those useless flashbacks to 1000 years ago...

+ Visuals - Boring plot - Uninteresting ""creator"" of transformers - ""Creator"" never told why they were made - Irrelevant 14 year old girl in the movie for only first 15 minutes - Nemesis Prime didn't make sense at all

Do yourself a favor and do NOT see this movie, it's not worth it. Rather go watch the first 3 again.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"the mediocrity of this movie can be judged from the fact that even though i am a die hard transformer fan ,i fell asleep thrice during the movie . disjointed story line ,useless cgi effects ,bad one liners and lack of any decent plot makes this the worst transformer movie to date . don't know what the studio executives are thinking but ppl genuinely just don't watch transformer movies for the cool CGI . there has to be a plot and some character development . too many transformers showed up for too few a mins to actually enjoy anyone of them. story moved at the speed of light from one continent to the other and actors looked as lame as forced kids uttering bad monologues through out the movie . if anything universal studio needs some decent script writers to actually make a worthwhile transformer movie . and they don't necessary have to save the entire world every time . the no. of times they have destroyed the pyramids its a wonder they are still standing . in short only watch if u must for the flashy CGI nothing much to see other than that . what a waste of good actors",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I'm confused.

This movie was unintelligible.

It literally made no sense. It reminded me of Highlander 2.

Just rewrite everything we've learned in the prior 4 movies.

I'm not padding this review.

Bay has no right to take these money's and make this drivel. .",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Disgusting trash only mindless bots would appreciate. The story starts where the other leaves us, in some ragged Trump city of the dead. I'm not sure who these 'tweens are but i hope annoying characters like them only exist in the writers sick minds. Heaven forbid I'm not a fan of the series but if its' an escape into the toilet of cgi formula, you have it all magnificently here in black and blue. Good luck.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I don't really have much to say, but it is with deep sadness and sorrow that I have to say.... this movie is a PIECE OF WORTHLESS CRAP. I'm a huge transformers fan, and I really tried hard to like this one. But no, it just wouldn't happen. Michael Bay thinks that he can put together pieces of story lines and plots and action, and make a nice movie out of it. NOPE. That ain't gonna work this time. It is literally what he did in the previous 4 movies. The first one turned out to be a success, the second one was fairly good, the third one was... meh..., the fourth one was a start to a bad future, and now, the fifth one is a disaster. Honestly after seeing the fourth one, I kinda expected this one to go downhill. You can literally put the ratings of the five movies on a line graph and you will see the line beginning its crash landing to 0 stars.

Oh and one more thing. I'm also kind of a die-hard Star Wars fan... Michael Bay seemed to be out of inspiration and ideas. In the movie, there were parts which were clearly Star Wars ripoffs. For instance when the drones were dispatched to hunt down Cade. The drones were literally mini TIE fighters!!!!!! Disney should be sueing Michael Bay's ass for that intellectual theft.

Transformers has gone stale. If only they can find a better director for this franchise, there will be some hope of recovering this franchise. Transformers, you just thousands of fans. I doubt if this franchise will go on any longer. They should really just quit. Marvel and DC have taken over.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"The Movie Feel like a marketing gimmick to simply get money by adding expensive effects. In fact, one gets the feeling that action sequences were shot at will and then added together added to that the movie was a long one and you would want to escape from the movie after 30 minutes of run time. I thought that the last Transformers outing was bad but this one beats it hands down. The best thing about the movie was the effects they are perfectly made and executed and the worst was the whole narration. Humor was overdone completely which takes the intensity of the script (if there was any) away. Simply a Bad Movie I would recommend STAY AWAY and save your 2 1/2 hours of time.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Another CGI-feast, the story, the movie, so bad, boring, I don't know what else to say, if you are older than 12 years just skip this one, well, maybe if you are a super-nerd of the Transformers franchise watch just to complete your addiction behavior and fan-mission. I liked the first 2 movies, but this one is a pure waste of lifetime, and even more bad as part 4 and 3.

Now we got even Merlin and King Arthur in, Transformers 6 may present us: Bumblebee fighting side by side with the almighty Santa Claus ;)

Terrible.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Really please stop making these movies. The special affects are incredible. But the rest is just boring, predictable and annoying. I would like to point out that since the 1st movie, you have a plot point that negates the previous movie. Every movie is X the reason they are here. Meaning that the X from the previous movie was not the reason they were there.

I would love to give the movie a 1 but if I am being objective, the acting was good, the effects were good but that's it. There is so much of the movie you could cut out and it would make it a lot better. Get rid of the whole military ark. The story would still suck but it would be shorter and more packed with the autobots, witch is the only thing that is interesting. Also, if you want to put romance, expand on it. If not then just drop it because doing it half way is just cringy.

All in all, do not spend money watching this movie. Vote with your dollars so that the talent of the people working on this movie can be use for better movies. Or at the very least show that we need a better writer for the franchise but my guess is that it has been ran into the ground and nothing could save it anyway. So for me, I will not watch any more of them.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"This is it! this is really the last straw in Michael bay Unepic Transformers movie. This movie will convinced everyone that enough is enough for this franchise. Michael Bay just can't write or direct consistent making plot and emotions breathe. Everything in this movie jumbled into abomination that both ugly inside out.

Talented people from VFX and concept designers that actually has some merits in their works wasted by Michael Bay directions and convoluted story cookie cutter. This people deserved better just as the fans and movie audiences.

Vote with your wallet is the only way to make it better. Michael Bay is done! Let this franchise dead and maybe! Just maybe! in 4-5 years or so, Hollywood would actually care about making a coherent enjoyable good movie.

Story: 3/10

actors performances: 5/10 (even the great sir Anthony Hopkins can't save it. This movie is a career killer.)

Sounds and Musics: 2/10

Cinematography: 2/10

VFX and art designs: 7/10 (the only kinda redeeming quality)

Overall final verdict: 3/10",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I think I lost count of how many times I rolled my eyes watching this movie and I'm a pretty lenient critic at the best of times. It's by far the worst film of the series. No plot, terrible characters, tired clichés and just plain dumb dialogue (nothing new) I remember going to see the first film, I was amazed and excited seeing the first 'transforming', the humour fitted in well and the film flowed to a point. The Last Knight however is just a total mess and casts a huge regret over the whole series. It would have benefited so much more by losing Michael Bays ego after the first couple of movies. What a waste",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"This movie was terrible, I am offended that the producer thought it was fine to crap all over the English.

1 scene in particular that upset me was at 10 Downing street, how Anthony Hopkins just strolls in through some back door and manages to end up in a room with the prime minister, give me a break.

I gave the review a 3 because it still had plenty of action and i liked the butler transformer.

This is one transformer movie i will never watch again, all the other films before this one i have watched many times.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"The worst entry in the series. What the hell are they thinking while making this? There were a lot of stuff I actually liked in this film but would've only worked if they were 2 or 3 different films. There are a bunch of names in the credits as editors but it seems like they just gave chance to anyone that came into the editing room to edit. The last time I was disappointed with editing was Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice theatre cut, but that looked great compared to this abominable editing. I am one of the few who likes both the first and second Transformers films and while the aspect ratio change made the action sequences in the second film look epic here they are just doing it randomly anywhere they want to do it. Nothing makes any sense. The plot is such a mess that there are no plot holes instead there is plot in hole. Any humour they tried to put in between serious situation felt retarded in here. Some of the ideas like incorporating ancient myths to alien technology etc were interesting and the special effects were good but overall disappointing.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Hollywood people forgot about the goodstoryline, characters and the music completely. Instead we get a lot of irrantional ideas and ton of special effects. Nothing more. Waste of time.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I don't expect more than an over the top action movie... but man was this a steaming pile of garbage. Just because it's a familiar franchise doesn't mean you stop being creative.

C'mon guys... no more Michael Bay please. Thanks!",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,I've watched all other transformers films and consider myself a fan. But this one cannot be enjoyed even by a fan. Its just so fail. Feels like there are many movies going on in there at once and I honestly gave up watching. I did try for whole 2 hours at that point even my fandom could not keep me going. The franchise should go to a different director and different plot writer if they want to save this.,3
Transformers: The Last Knight,I literally fell asleep while watching this... at the movie theater. On that terminology still not the worst transformers movie.,3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Transformers 1 - 4 great! Transformers 5 I end up shutting off about 30 mins in, tried 3 different times to watch. It feels like a repeat of what I seen before only 80 percent worse and more boring. It's not funny it starts off with kids and acts like we know them already, but there hasn't been any character development to make me care about them. I think better would have been a continuation of Mark Walberg's character where the 4th left off. I think the begin with the Transformers being a part of King Arthur is getting old and dry that formula has been overused with them being part of our history. I'm going to make a attempt to watch the movie past 30 mins but it's such a let down compared to the others. The other 4 are insane great with the acting, cinematography and action, very entertaining while 5 seems like a boring repeat it's missing its core characters and great character chemistry.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"How many times must megabolts die come on??

The lead villain gets 2 minutes scream time & the several times failed mega bolts gets, well, more. Besides blowing stuff up and being blown up I have No idea what human characters are about.

Written by 3rd raters if any, suspect CGI is king, unfortunately at no time is my mind on the watching of this mess.

Great idea making Prime a villain but like rest of characters lts lost in the mess of a massive time span, dinosaurs, Merlin, knights, and an evil Tinkerbell etc.",3
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Transformers:The Last Knight is the 5th movie in the Transformers franchise and is once again directed by Michael Bay who directed all of the previous ones and Mark Wahlberg (who was in the fourth one) returns once again in a leading role. Once again, it's visually impressive, but not much more than that.

I didn't hate it. It was too bonkers for that. It tried to further the story and made the whole thing crazier than it already was. Once again, it's a cheese fest, with a lot of CGI (but pretty good CGI, say what you want), jokes that fall flat (although I gotta admit a few were alright) and a thin plot that you don't care about and you lose interest in the plot halfway through, as crazy as it seemed at first. The acting is okay, in some cases cheesy, but why the surprise? It's cheesy, but still, it's fun. At least still better than The Fate of the Furious, which was a lazy cash-grab that didn't do anything new. But still, this isn't very good either, as fun as it is. I saw the movie less than 3 hours ago and I already don't remember half of it, so it's still somehow forgettable, even though it's insane. But if you're a fan of this franchise, what's not to like, I guess? If you're not, it's probably a waste of time for you. But still, you might enjoy it if you just want action and a nice theater experience.

It was still fun, very visually pleasing and I liked how it tried to kinda reinvent the series and explore the universe, but it makes it tough to actually care with its poor writing, non- existent character development, a kinda tedious first half and a thin and not very gripping plot with some plot points being completely glossed over just to end the thing. But again, you can't expect this to be a masterpiece, so I can't say I'm disappointed.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I was very excited to watch the movie, especially it had the legendary Anthony Hopkins, but I was really disappointed. First of all the plot is terrible & repeatable. The acting is less than adequate. As for the special effects, it's nothing new for the Transformers series. So let's talk about the plot like previous movies it's the ultimate battle to bring the home planet of the aliens (The Transformers) to replace the earth nothing new here. And the lucky heroes that going to save the planet are casual civilians go figure and their backup is special ops and some Autobots lead by Optimus as usual. The thing that I felt was really ridiculous is the need to connect to old England with always mythical figure of King Arthur and his knights and inclusion of Stanley Tucci in this humorous way wasn't really a stroke of genius from Michael Bay more like a Box Office thing same with Sir Anthony Hopkins although I love the acting of the man been rusty on some of the scenes and probably the fault of the director, honestly. In general, it's a movie I wouldn't advise to pay a nickel to go and watch.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"""Transformers: The Last Knight"" is directed by Michael Bay and is the fifth film in the ""Transformers"" franchise. So before I jump in I should give a little background on what I think about the ""Transformers"" films in general. I think that the four that came before ""The Last Knight"" are great assuming that you know what you're walking into. You won't get an incredible story, you won't get engaging characters, but you will get some robots fighting each other and lots of explosions. So with that in mind, I went into this film expecting the same. I did see that the reviews were not going well before going in, but I also figured it'd still be rather enjoyable. I was wrong. ""The Last Knight"" is the worst movie of the year. The usual ""Transformers"" movie issues are there, but somehow they didn't even get the stuff that made the others enjoyable right. I was extremely disappointed.

Plot

Oh yes, the plot! One of the most important parts of a film! Well, lemme tell you, the plot in ""The Last Knight"" is not interesting, at all. The first 45-minutes of this film felt like an eternity, and it felt like the story I was being told was made up by a middle-schooler and loosely connected during an English class. It's that bad. And yeah, I am aware that I just said that ""Transformers"" movies usually do not have a great story but I still enjoy them. Well, this story is much, much worse than any of the other ""Transformers"" movies. It doesn't flow well, it is not gripping in the slightest, and the conclusion, while the most entertaining part of the movie, fell flat for me. I feel like the biggest problem with this movie is that there is way, way, way too much time given to the humans. You thought that there was too much screen time given to the humans in the other movies? Well, this one it feels like the entire story is about the humans and the Transformers are just there as side characters. I go to a ""Transformers"" movie to see Transformers, not humans talking about Transformers. In the end, the lackluster plot of ""The Last Knight"", even by ""Transformers"" standards, is one of the biggest reasons why this movie is not worth the price of admission.

Script

Besides the plot being rather bad, the script is outright terrible. They hit you with joke, after joke, after joke, and maybe two of them land. Yep, two out of the entire movie. Not only are the jokes bad, but a lot of the dialogue is poorly written. There is nothing truly insightful said. In fact, I feel like too much is said in this film. Characters continue talking when there really is no need for anymore dialogue. Again, the scripts for the past ""Transformers"" films weren't all that great, either, and they had plenty of cringe-worthy moments themselves. But this film takes the cringe to another level. You definitely need to turn your brain off for this one.

Characters

I can't fault ""The Last Knight"" for shallow, boring human characters, because that's one of the main trademarks of the series. There's always the main human hero (Cade), an attractive female (Vivian), and plenty of smart people (such as Sir Edmund) and government peeps. You're not meant to get attached to them. You're meant to get attached to the Transformers, which again brings up the issue of the Transformers not getting enough screen time, but I digress.

This brings me to the Transformers. Surprisingly, most of them are not that interesting, either. Some of them actually got pretty annoying as the movie went on. Bumblebee is the stand out (shocker), and if anything this got me more excited for the standalone film he's getting.

Overall, both the Transformers characters and the human characters disappoint. Another swing and miss for the crew that put this film together.

Potential Audience

If you're not a huge ""Transformers"" fan, do not see this movie in theaters. Save your money and go see ""Wonder Woman"", or ""Baby Driver"", or any other movie coming out this summer. If you are a pretty big ""Transformers fan"", though, then go get your ass to the movie theater. I'm sure you'll enjoy it despite how bad it is.

As far as maturity goes, I'd say anyone above the age of 10 could see this movie.

Conclusion

In the end, ""The Last Knight"" is the worst ""Transformer""s film yet and one of the worst films of the year. The story is bad, there's not enough screen time given to the Transformers, there's not enough action, and it has a very mediocre ending.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Suspension of disbelief is completely broken. Story is confusing at every turn. Great effects, but effects do not make a movie. They need to refocus and maybe make a transformers movie based on story. Sometimes you should take a step back and ask if this works, before spending millions of dollars to make a movie.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"This movie is the worst of the saga (considering the general low quality of the franchise, this is one of the lower points of Cinema). I've seen recently some bad blockbuster movies, like Guardian of the Galaxy vol.2, but each one had a distinct style, maybe a poor plot but a plot at least. In this movie there isn't a real plot, logic doesn't exist. It's funny this movie gainsays totally what we've seen on Transformers for a decade. The problem is this ret-con is illogical and no-sense. Besides, there are too much characters (both humans and robots) managed badly. I think Michael Bay and the Production are completely disinterested in representing well or in the right way the Transformers! The only thing matters is boom, bang, explosions, chaos-battle, a stupid rifle-stick that hurts Megatron (I'm not joking) and a simple statement that changes the evil Prime in the common Optimus Prime we know. Absurd!",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"From my side, the movie would be rated ""Unnecessary/10"". Seriously, Michael Bay, stop ! Make it your last Transformers movie. Abort the mission....To be exact, if I would seriously rate this movie, I would rate it 4.5/10, and 4.5 is a very generous rating coming from me. I wanted to love the movie, I really wanted to, I loved the previous ones, but this one just felt so unnecessary, repetitive, and boring at some parts, I even found myself sighing and rolling my eyes at some scenes.

*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOOOOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*

What I did not like in TF:The Last Knight was that it was similar to the second movie in the franchise, Revenge Of The Fallen. In Revenge of The Fallen, the Cybertronians and the earthlings have crossed paths before, and in TF: The Last Knight, Humans (the Knights) and the Cybertronians crossed paths and fought together (Correct me if Im wrong). In Revenge of The Fallen, the Primes decided to hide the ""Matrix of Leadership"" by sealing it in a tomb. In TF:TLK, the 12 Knights of Cybertron had to guard the staff, just like how the Primes were guarding the Matrix of Leadership. The staff was housed in a tomb as well, the Tomb of Merlin to be specific, and the ship that the Tomb of Merlin was found in was also some sort of alien robots tomb. In Revenge of The Fallen, Jetfire the Oldtimer Decepticon told Sam and the others that only a Prime can defeat the Fallen, and in TF:TLK, only Vivienne can wield the staff of Quentessa. And TF:TLK had the same story where there was something that the Autobots/Decepticons were going after, just like in the first movie, they were going after the All-Spark, however, in this one they were looking for the Staff.....Everything just felt so repetitive, did we really need this movie ? When the trailer first came out, I expected it to be epic, and I was surprised that it wasn't as I expected it to be. Anyways, there's still one movie left to come (I hope), and I hope it is going to be way much better that this one. Also, I am kinda wondering how Unicron, which might be a colossal Decipticon, be portrayed in the live-action movie...Looking forward to Michael Bay's next, and hopefully last Transformers movie of the franchise.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Transformers: A masterpiece. 10/10

Transformers: RoTF 3/10 Transformers: DOTM 6/10 Transformers: AoE 8/10

I watched Transformers: The Last Knight and was dissatisfied with the projector. It seemed dark and the picture images were not that sharp as I have seen previously in IMAX with Laser.

Script: A staff in lieu of the cube this time. We have seen the ""chosen one"" a million times.

Main Actor: Wahlberg was looking silly when Optimus Prime was fighting with the Decepticons.

Side Actor: Hot as always. Hopkins was the saving grace, though we will not see him again.

Verdict: Please stop and end the series. Otherwise, the next T-6 will flop badly and end up like Terminator: Genisys. The producers should opt for an animation Series in order to respect the audience's I.Q.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,I was really expecting something new & had high hopes that I'll see something more about Transformers origins but ultimately it is just a disappointment. Most of the movie sequences have already been tried in previous movies also there was no romantic chemistry between Mark & Haddock. I hope Michael Bay brings a better movie next time.,4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"The story had some interesting elements in the beginning but completely fell off the rails near the last hour. It was another mess by Michael Bay. The worst one in the entry for sure. Brought nothing new to the franchise. Cheesy one liners, bad stereotype Transformers and horrible action. I really hope this is Bay's last one, the series need some major work to get my attention again.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"What a load of S#*t, You have a 14-year old that looks like she's should be in a Barney movie, then we have Mark Wahlberg, and we all know his only ""good"" performance was in Pain and Gain! Then we have Laura Haddock, which is Star-Lord (Guardians of the Galaxy) mother, and In another Marvel movie, but let's not cover her acting career. The CGI was just amazing, but the acting and the one liners that were not even funny, and kids saying words which they shouldn't be saying this movie has lost everything it could have been, It feels like I've watched the same movie, but like a mashup of all the 4 old transformers movies! What a complete waste. In other words, - Game of Thrones meets stranger things, meets a weird, bad acting porn parody meets the worst movie, meets load noise and the Screen resolution kept changing. = Another bad, worthless Michael Bay movie.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"seriously, too much Chinese element, and I don't know good kinds. It's endless ads, commercials, embedded throughout the whole movie. And there are not even good ads; i rather watch Superbowl commercials; at least they have wist in them. Movie-wise, there is a reason this is the director's last Transformer movie, it's pretty chaotic. Half of the time they are fighting, for reasons unexplained (?, i am sure there are many arguments there).

And what's the deal with Bumble Bee's involvement in WWII!? Wasn't he just landed Earth in the First Transformer movie? I hope this is the last Transformer movie i'll see.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"The movie was long as a Chewing gum, you could even feel the aftertaste in the mouth . 2 words ... Not Good . As i'm a big fan of all the transformers movies, i was looking forward to this movie. unfortunately as i stated above ,it missed big time . In my opinion the first movies, were much much better you can't even compare .",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"The first thing I want to point out is that I've been a fan of the Transformers movie-franchise since the first movie and that I love them all, even Age of Extinction. This movie though, a disappointment to the franchise. A very thin plot, with a lot of weird switches between shots and places. One moment Mark Wahlberg's Cade Yaeger rescues some children by bringing them outside of the city and when the shot changes he immediately is in the middle of the city again. The thing that bothered me the most is that the original idea that Bumblebee couldn't speak but communicated with his radio speaker was brilliant, but got canceled at the end of the movie when Nemesis Prime tries to kill Bumblebee. He immediately can speak with his own voice while that hasn't been working for 4(!) movies!

TL:DR; Disappointed by the decisions Bay made this movie.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"""Transformers: The Last Knight,"" is the only installment of the five Transformers series that I have seen. I am not much of a Sci-Fi fun but I relished much of the script, credulous direction and general dynamics of the characters in the movie. A single particular detail stultified my pleasure in the movie: A beautiful scene of a desert was displayed and described as; Namibia, West Africa.

Now: as an African and particularly a Zambian with Namibian descent, the inaccuracy with which Namibia was described got me wondering if the Writers, Script editors, Prompters, Producers and Directors of this movie could be bothered by the perception of its African and Namibian following. The corollary to this is: is Africa considered (by Hollywood) as one enormous country as opposed to the vast and divergent Continent that it is?

Indulge me Mr Michael Bay, Ian Bryce, Tom Desanto, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Brian Goldner et al. Surely, a little research never hurt anybody! Take a leak from Shonda Rhimes.

On the foregoing score,""Transformers: The Last Knight is to me a 4!",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"It is the same old story again: the world of Transformers doesn't know the word, 'peace' (or pace), and this time social ecosystem of Michael Bay's robots is intimidated by a possibly underestimated ancient threat, which has possibly been implanted into the humans' culture. this fifth incarnation of the Hasbro toy franchise is probably the most powerful mix of action sequences and clamorous special effects, which, interestingly, could strike with a decent dose of drowsiness. it lasts two and a half hours, and watching it in IMAX 3D was a total hit for my eyes. however, it was still a traumatizing experience at the same time, because it faces the issue of reanimating the series for the fifth time with the inability of creating a narrative story, which is compensated by eye-catching explosions.

Mixing the elements of human history and the mythology of the Transformers might be a cliché of the saga today, but in this sequel we are kind of pushed to the boundaries of surrealism: Merlin, Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table signifying the base of the main story (not if there was any other thread), by revoking an ancient legend which could signal serious threats to the humans and the Autobots altogether. surprisingly, this issue will be handled by Mark Wahlberg and the beautiful, ever-vulgar Laura Haddock. As the movie aspires to project a coherent picture front of our eyes, it, instead, succeeds to be lost in the introduction of too many characters. It is accompanied by action scenes so amazing which almost reach uncharted peaks, but it would still be more effective if they were a little bit more condensed in a shorter time.

In sum, the movie is visually powerful, a vortex of palpitating and impacting action, which smashes your retina. From the direction point of view, this flick has, again, managed to be admired by the fans of beautifully depicted destruction. If we didn't get enough splinters flying right into our eyes in the 4th chapter, this time we should definitely wear more defensive head gears. However, if you were hungering for more, than one-hour narration of a story which can be concluded in two sentences, followed by a 90 minutes incessant sequence of action blast, then this blockbuster will not be your cup of tea, since it doesn't offer much more, compared to the previous three installments.

Rating: 4/10",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Jesus! What happen?...This movie have exactly the same problem that UNDERWORLD,RESIDENT EVIL & FAST AND FURIOUS....they become the ""same thing"" in every movie.

Yes,Yes...the movie have explosions,action,adventure,etc,etc,etc but we already see this before the problem with movie is that don't have nothing new and the fault is MICHAEL BAY!

I haven't see a good movie of BAY since THE ROCK and that was 20 years ago!...i think the movie need new blood,new ideas,new visions...not the same time every movie (remember he already make 5 movies in the road)...the acting is OK...but like i say before is all jumping,screaming,etc.

I really hope that some one in Paramout read this and the next time make something new...oh i forgot!...they already make it BUMBLEBEE:The movie right now...Damn! too late!",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I wouldn't say I'm the greatest fan of the franchise but I've always enjoyed the Transformers movies.

This one is enjoyable, even if a bit overly generic and extremely kitschy. It is the baby born from a very bad, if not stupid idea and a huge budget to waste on it.

The plot is horrible and the premise on which the movie is based on is garbage (I mean, come on, when I saw medieval warfare I expected another ancient prophecy-based plot but the moment I heard King Arthur and Merlin it was difficult not to take the movie as a bad joke), but even so the movie was worth a watch. I enjoyed it even if I cringed quite a lot during the beginning. Don't expect anything from the story but be prepared to enjoy some low-rate comedy and really nice explosions with a bonus of fairly decent CGI. It's similar to a child's bedtime story to which you just add Michael Bay.

Oh and...spoiler alert (not really) : this will have a part 2.

Ehh - I guess I'd say give it a shot if you've got nothing better to do or watch, it's a good time if you bring a friend along to laugh it off and some popcorn to make time pass faster.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I'm gonna be short..from acting,editing and pretty much everything it is just awful. For a movie that had 200 000 000 dollars budget it's embarrassing M.Bay came up with this,but it was expected anyway...just watch the trailer,it is way better then this two and a half hour piece of... thanks",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT First of all, I didn't like any of the transformers movies for the same reason. They tried always to cram to much stuff into the movie, to many unrelated things going on, there is NOT ONE single shot longer than 10 seconds, everything in the movie seems rushed and too fast. The characters don't even get 30 seconds to introduce themselves, have dinner, or tell a joke that isn't rushed or too fast. The plot is too complicated and too much stuff, I mean, not every single movie HAS to be about THE END OF THE WORLD , seriously, every time its 'the most important event in history"" . 4 stars because of the special effects, other then that, the transformers movies franchise died a long time ago, they are just milking it and adding stupid transformers, like a Vespa scooter, submarines, freaking' coffee machines , and i don't know what else. cheers",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I never doubt Mr. Bay's artwork. But this time I really have to say, Mr. Bay was working on explosions instead of focusing on the franchise.

You know what happened this time,

1. Amazing detailed, textured and mind blowing graphics were provided. 2. Oh! wait what, the story, well we will see about that. 3. Again sorry about the script. 4. Yes transformers are there, but...story.

Watch this movie at least once, that is the only thing what this movie deserves.",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,Well the movie is seriously pure garbage. The plot is very bad or very badly presented. There was simply no sense to how and what the characters were doing as opposed to what was or should be happening. The least I expected is a decent action but the movie fails in providing that also. The action is simply mindless maybe because they tried too much to showoff or maybe because they didn't even tried. If you can avoid seeing this movie do that but if you want to see the movie just for the sake of it well then go ahead and get ready to be disappointed.,4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"Review: This epic movie certainly looked amazing and the attention to detail was great but from an entertainment point of view, it was a total let down. The storyline was all over the place, and the human characters became extremely annoying after a while, except for Anthony Hopkins (Sir Edmund Burton), and his reliable robot Cogman, voiced by Jim Carter. Mark Wahlberg (Cade Yeager) didn't seem like he wanted to be there most of the time, and Laura Haddock (Vivian Wembley), the Angelina Jolie lookalike, didn't suit her role. Stanley Tucci (Merlin) made me laugh and Josh Duhamel (Colonel William Lennox) played a convincing soldier but I didn't see the point to the little girl Isabela Monet (Isabella), who seemed to get in the way most of the time. Anyway, with the Autobots still at war with the Decepticons, as usual, the humans are out to capture all of the Transformers, and with Optimus Prime gone, they are all in hiding with Cade helping them to survive. Optimus Prime finds his dead home planet, Cybertron, and meets his alleged creator, Quintessa, who tells him that he needs to get Merlin's staff to absorb Earth's energy to restore their home-world. Meanwhile, Cade is given a precious mechanical talisman from a dying Autobot Knight, and while he is battling against the TRF drones, he is approached by Cogman who invites him to the UK to meet his employer, Sir Edmund Burton, who shows him the history of the Transformers and the power of the staff. To get to the staff, he needs the help of Vivian Wembley, who is a English Literature Professor and has the power to control the staff, so they set of on there mission, with Optimus Prime close behind them. Whilst battling against the TRF and Quintessa's soldiers, there is a race to get to the staff before it destroys earth. There was much thought behind the storyline but I personally thought that it was a right mess. It also lacked wit and there wasn't much depth to the various characters. With that aside, the action scenes were half decent and the transformers looked great but it wasn't enough to save the movie. I really think that they need to go back to the drawing board with this franchise, because all of the movies haven't been that great, and they seem to be getting worse. If they do decide to release another Transformers, they really need to think about character building, more than the CGI content, even though it made a decent profit at the box office. Average!

Round-Up: This movie was directed by Michael Bay, who brought you the Bad Boys franchise, The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbour, The Island, The Transformers franchise, the great Pain & Gain and 13 Hours. With so many hit movies behind him, I'm not surprised of the scale of this movie but I still wasn't impressed with the outcome. The corny script and poor acting has been the main problem with the whole franchise but they all seem to make a lot of money, for some unknown reason. With another Transformers movie in the pipeline, due to be released in 2019, I hope that they choose another director for the project, who will give it a fresh concept, and hopefully a decent cast.

Budget: $217million Worldwide Gross: $605.5million

Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Hopkins, Josh Duhamel, Laura Haddock, Santiago Cabrera, Stanley Tucci, John Turturro, Isabela Moner, Jerrod Carmichael, with the voices from Peter Cullen, John Goodman, Ken Watanabe, Jim Carter, Steve Buscemi and Omar Sy. 4/10",4
Transformers: The Last Knight,"I rated the previous Transformers movies 6-7 stars, so you can see this is really a new low. Actually, it's the lowest rating that I have given a movie.

Action scenes have nothing new. Characters are all unlikable who behave like total jerks. We know Transformers movies are not famous for storytelling, but this time 80% of the plot has no logic at all. Most of the diagoues make no sense like they are just there to fill up screen time. This makes the movie really unwatchable and I got a headache in the middle of the movie.

When compared to this movie, Age of Extiniction instanly becomes a masterpiece. Please avoid this junk. Do something meaningless. It is still better than getting yourself sick and pissed.",4

Venom,"Comics was good, just needed to be as comics and thats it. This movie is all wrong, Hardy isnt in his place here at all, he aint suit this at all. Mediocre is a word to describe everything about this cinema experience. First of all, atroscious and generic as f charachters, Hardy doesnt belong here at all. Graphics is mediocre, script is nothing. We've seen this kind of movie gazillion of times over and over again. This comics thing needs to be resetted, rebooted and forgetted forever, if not, mediocratia is coming for all of you. Jesus, Tom, what u have putted yourself into? You are an amazing actor, how the f it happened you are here in this so called movie? MEDIOCRE AND GENERIC AS F.

p.s. also the end title tune, no, worst, the worst possible. em, you were awsm, now u dead.",1

Venom,"What in the world was that? This film was so bad, so so bad. I love Tom Hardy but even he was terrible in this. The director must be to blame. This film was so bad.",1
Venom,"Major plot line and elements stolen from Wesley Chu's Tao series of books. Unashamedly so. It all masked up with stray elements from the world of Spider-Man. In the end, almost nothing is ""Venom"" and it doesn't measure up with other ""superhero"" movies. Wasted effort.",1
Venom,"After soooo many great titles from Marvel post Iron Man (2008) they make ""this"". In my mind this is a DC movie (like their best) but its just trash... can't believe they are filming Venom 2 which looks even worst with their $0,99 VFX.",1

Venom,"Unless you are into this comics it's a waste of your time, bad acting, bad CGI, bad plot, no story.

I stopped watching in the middle, simply unbearable, how did Tom Hardy agree to return to this character after the 1st movie is beyond me, probably a lot of money changed his mind.",1
Venom,"And the award for the laziest, most derivative, most unoriginal, dumbest, worst acted, worst-written & directed piece of utterly disposable and utterly predictable garbage goes to ....",1
Venom,I'm not a fan of venom and never have been but this new interpretation is an insult to my intelligence but I guess if you don't have any then you'll love this movie.. Tom Hardy plays himself playing an alien symbiote creature that takes over his body and wants to help him do smashy man child things! I could have been more bored in a movie if I was sitting there lightening to Margot Robbie spit femanazti bs. Smashy man smashes things and cringy dialogue and more smashing and then he's the hero but sort of not and then random lady venom for no reason so it doesn't seem like this movie is sexist and man childish! Ooohh ahhhhh oohhhh. 10/10.,1
Venom,How dare you speak so ill of our God Aren't you afraid that you will be punished so badly in this life time to be an example to all who dare do such a thing. This is a very bad movie from A to Z and i will wait and see how God will curse you infront of everyone to make an example out of you. May God Speed,1
Venom,"That was probably the worst move I've seen in my whole life. I can't really say I have seen it, because I stopped watching after the chase scene. It was enough, I've seen enough, it's really horrible.

I have no luck with Tom Hardy, first Fury Road, now this.

Bad acting, boring plot, laughable CGI.

Don't watch it, it's only for the brain dead.",1
Venom,"I sometimes wonder if Marvel is the Psi-Op's department of the CIA and its writers they employ are perpetuating the official myths of the American way of life.

Perhaps it all started as a 1950's experiment in how to dehumanise the American public, so that they would become indifferent to the killing of innocent civilians.

I can imagine them saying, lets expose everyone to enormous amounts of violence, in glorious colour, backed by music and sound effects, all in the name of good conquering evil.

Then we can create all the wars we want, steal all the resources we need and paint other evolved cultures and religions as evil.

Hum..........

This violent boring vapid movie contains great acting from Tom Hardy but it is the relentless body count and violence that lets the movie down.

Once upon a time, Heroes stood up for the weak, the poor, the undefended, they had a message to convey to the world.

Sadly that time is over in this Marvel universe.",1
Venom,A movie like this has to be good at all aspects. The acting here was so poor!!!,1
Venom,A Venom stan always put negative comments on this A Star is Born .... They cant accepted that Venom was The WORST MOVIES ALL OF TIME ...!!!,1
Venom,"Venom lacks complete artistic qualities. Everything screams cgi millennial junk without anything interesting and exciting. This comes as No suprise because this Is how Most Marvel movies works. Pointless hollow action garbage. First of all. The symbios should be more like a blsck watery goo. Instead it looks like a crystal shaped blue spiky thing. There's countless of colorful marvel villains for venom to fight, Instead its the typical marvel all cgi battles and he doesnt meet resistance to the very late fight scene. It would have been a million times better If he actually just fought somebody that wasn't cgi at all. It's just too much of bad videogame graphics involved. Pointless moviemaking and cheap looking fights. Venom stinks because there's not even one believable fight scene that carries weight. Deadpool has a number of them. Watchmen works. Batman has the best. Why does hollywood spew out this trash is beyond me? They must be trolling. Why in earth would anyone like this? It has no exciting story. No exciting love affair. Hej would Eddie ever want the soon to be wife back? They where supposed to be marry then the next day or week she acts like arobot allready dating someone new. She has to feel no symphaty and feelings whatsoever. And my biggest issue with venom is after credits roll and we get to see carnage? Wait what! Woody Isnt even close looking. The Only actor in the world that can play carnage to perfection should be Jackey earley haley or even Ben Foster would make him justice. Its like a 10 year old have directed this piece of..",1
Venom,"The first 30 minutes seems promising, then that voice inside Hardy's head comes out and it's just unbearable to watch and just laughable",1

Stopped watching after 30 minutes before my eyes and ears would start bleeding. Do not waste your time on this. Please, just don't.",1
Venom,"Worse CGI from big studios in a decade. Stupdly terrible mediocre BAD acting, performances, etc. I have never watched such a bad movie in YEARS.",1

Venom,Not good in any kind of way. Please avoid this movie from watching. If you gonna watch you'll be disappointed in the end.,2
Venom,"Just rubbish. Carrion. Despite my low expectations. I've never seen a movie so easy. Characters so boring and superficial. The story pattern is as if it consisted of random events occurring with a series of coincidences. You don't understand what happened. It's open. Neither the story nor the characters have an infrastructure. Oh, Tom Hardy. Were you the man to compromise your quality for the sake of popularity? What about Michelle Williams? Anyway, it's not worth the language.",2
Venom,One of the worst Marvel movies I have ever seen!!!,2
Venom,This is the most pathetic cash grab I've seen in a long while. This is not a good movie in the slightest. Do not waste your time with this abomination,2
Venom,"Fun action, GREAT comedy, interesting story, and a likeable dynamic between Venom and Eddie Brock! Even of it can be formulaic, I still had a good time!",2
Venom,"I don't really write reviews on here, regardless of how good or bad a movie is, I've maybe done 2 or 3 tops. But for some reason I feel the need with this.

I really don't know where to start with Venom... which I guess puts me in the same room as the writers and director, because the whole thing is a mess from start to finish.

It just doesn't know what it's trying to be and as a result, isn't really catered in one direction or another.

The ""jokes"" are regular, but barring one smirk and snigger, were more eye rolling than anything else. The CGI is weak. The characters are 2 dimensional... scratch that, I don't think they had 2 dimensions even; the acting feels like they knew this wasn't going to turn out well; the storyline... well, flawed is being extremely kind. It's barely there. The action/fight sequences feel like something from a Michael Bay Tansformers movie for the most part (anyone who just asked what the problem with that is: get out now); as for the Venon ""character"" - it's just annoying in this movie and not remotely funny.... like a turd rolling down a hill (that's an actual line.... Jesus).

Honestly, there are 2 films I can think of, where I've been close to suggesting we give up and walk out of the cinema: Bird-man and this.

All I can think is that Tom Hardy's fan base is extremely loyal and that others enjoyed seeing Michelle Williams runaround in a short skirt (ok, I liked that too). I pray they don't make a sequel or if they do, they treat this as having never happened and start over with it.

Awful. Awful. Awful.",2
Venom,Feels the a first time director from the 90s following cliche after cliche. So glad I waited to stream it. The actors feel like they know it's gonna be bad so gave it half effort.,2
Venom,Can't give this minus five stars so I'll settle for two. Would be zero if not for the excellent Hardy. One of the worst films I have ever seen. A boring mess.,2
Venom,"The wholes in the story, such as plot's convenience, makes a hard experience to take the move seriously. The ideia of villain Venom does not work at all as he becomes bff with Eddie. Bad development and outcome.",2
Venom,To be honest it is not a bad movie. The actors are doing it well. But when you are a gaan of the comic version of venom this really hurt your eyes. The anti hero of venom could be a great litle dark marvel movie. Instead of that they make it a kind of clowesk fart so women and childeren can also enjoy the movie..... They ruind my memories from my yought with this crap. The maximum carnage story would be great in the MCU but how can you portrai Venom when he is like this. It would ruin the plot.,2
Venom,"Honestly I don't remember anything about this movie, except the after credit scene. I forgot everything that happened. I had to watch a recap to watch the 2nd movie. It's just so bad. Possibly 1 star. It's supposed to highlight Tom Hardy, I guess, but he's not that great. The Venom symbiote tries to be funny, but it's not. Venom is supposed to be evil or a super-villian, but they try to make him an anti-villain, at best, I guess? Again it's so bad, I wish Sony had control of this so he could be a part of the Spiderman univers, but he's not and it really is just so bad. Venom acts if he's not in control and he's just a bad comedian that tries to take over and be a goofball companion instead of being an alien symbiote that is an evil-supervillian that rivals Spiderman.",2
Venom,"First off, Tom Hardy's version of Eddie Brock whines like Bobcat Goldthwait (which, believe me, is definitely not a good thing). Secondly; the computerized distortion used for his Venom voice makes him sound more like the love child of Clancy Brown and Andrew Divoff. Third? The story line is literally more yawn-able than the plot for Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"" back in 2004. Fourth; also like ""Catwoman,"" there is only the thinnest of connections to the original superhero comic that gave birth to this anti-hero (i.e. an ill-fated astronaut named Jameson). And, last but not least?

Including me, there were less than ten people in the theater for the matinee showing I went to see. And this is the opening weekend!

In short: go see A STAR IS BORN. The relationship there will be a lot more believable than the one between Hardy's Brock and Michelle Phillips' Anne.",2
Venom,"This movie is bad! It's not well-written, it's not technically well-made, and it is stupid! However, I actually enjoyed it a little. Most of this movie I found to be slow and kinda dull. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, I started having fun. This movie is at its best when it is being crazy and over-the-top! However, there isn't a lot of that in the movie. That only really happens in the middle of the movie. It takes a long time to get going, it goes for a little bit, and then it just kinda ends abruptly before it even really begins. It's very poorly paced, probably because of the re-edits. I thought there must've been more to this movie, I was only 90 minutes into what's supposed to be a 110-minute movie, but nope! That was it! There are, no joke, 20 minutes of credits! That's including two post-credits scenes, but you can just turn the movie off after the first one. The second is just a clip from Into the Spider-verse, nothing special. I heard there were about 40 minutes of footage cut from the final film, and yeah. It shows. Overall, this movie is a hot mess. If you're in the mood for garbage, give it a watch. It's like one of those less-than-wonderful 70s and 80s B horror movies. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this. If you want an actually good movie with a similar premise, however, watch Upgrade instead.",2
Venom,"Venom is a generic cash grab that does not know whether he's a dark superhero movie or a silly comedy. Tom Hardy's bad spectacle, innumerable idiocy in The action and a confused effect massacre make Venom the kind of superhero films that do not work.

2,0",2
Venom,Didn't except this type of movie from marvel....Till the end.... Didn't know whether he is hero or villan ....Worst. ...Worst movie,2
Venom,"One of these movies you watch and then very soon afterwards you forget about it completely. And then you see it somewhere and ask yourself hey did I watch this movie, cause it looks so familiar... And you realize you, did but it was a complete waste of time. And finally you die a little inside.",2
Venom,"The design of Venom is better than the one from Spider-Man 3, he looks like he's straight out of the comics. That is where the good aspects of this movie end for me.

Sony had been trying to get a Venom movie made ever since the aforementioned Spider-Man 3. Though I'm a fan of the Venom character, I never particularly felt that he needed his own solo movie but still I remained cautiously optimistic about it. My expectations for Venom weren't particularly high to begin with but somehow it still managed to disappoint me.

The first major issue with Venom as a story is the lack of Peter Parker. A big part of both Eddie Brock and Venom's characters is their relationship with Peter Parker/Spider-Man, in fact he is the very reason that the Venom character we know even exists. Take away Spider-Man and you take away a big part of Venom's character and the story that makes him so interesting as an antihero.

Since Spider-Man is not in this story, Eddie Brock instead is turned into a generic hero type who lacks the complexity of his comic counterpart. Throughout the movie he reluctantly helps the Venom symbiote whose motivations and loyalty are ambiguous and unclear.

The actors give okay performances but feel like they aren't giving it their all. Supposedly Tom Hardy only agreed to be Venom because his son likes the character and it shows.

The attempts at humour are cringe inducing and often fall flat. It feels like they were trying to imitate the MCU's style of humour but it honestly feels more like the kind of humour you'd find in a Michael Bay Transformers movie.

The villain is forgettable and ultimately just ends up being a silver version of Venom. The CGI in the big fight between the two characters also doesn't look very good.

Overall I'm not really sure what everyone sees in Venom that makes it such a masterpiece, they must have been watching a completely different film. Despite my dislike of this Venom movie, I hope they will manage to fix some of these issues in the sequel and perhaps then we can get a worthy big screen adaptation of this character.",2
Venom,Disappointed with Tom Hardy. Rest of the movie was just terrible.,2
Venom,I was curious about the differences between the critics' and movie goers' reviews. The critics were right. I want my 2 hours back.,2
Venom,I just couldn't believe what I was watching it was so awful. It's as if they hadn't realised that comic book films have advanced so much over the past 20 years and assumed quality didn't matter.,2
Venom,This was not a good film . Dead pool set the bar for anti hero movies . This did not come close . More anti entertaining than anti hero,2
Venom,"The only reason I tried watching this, was Hardy. He's kinda fun. And I've read somewhere he looks like crap throughout entire movie, so I thought who knows, maybe it's not your typical hollywood mess.

Boy, it was a mistake. The entire movie is hard to look at. For starters, CGI. CGI always looks bad. At this point I don't even think it can be made better. Whatever is done with CGI will always look plastic and just bad and fake. Then there's Williams. She might as well be CGI herself, she just looks grating. In fact, the only thing movie has going for it, is that it feels like only half an hour watch. I mean, basically nothing happens anyway, there's no progression, when the thing decides it likes humans, it tells you so, nothing happened so that you might come to that conclusion your self. And it couldn't have, since movie is so short. Well, not really short, but feels short.

Still, how short it feels is not the reason I gave it another star. There were actually two good jokes there. I don't remember when was the last time hollywood movie made me giggle, so there. Two stars for two jokes.",2
Venom,"Ever since the release of 30 Minutes or Less, director Ruben Fleischer has appeared to be on a quest to ruin every ounce of respect he garnered for his hit, Zombieland. Given this most recent release, I am inclined to believe that his success with that film was by pure chance and fear what we have waiting for us in store with the release of the sequel next year. Still, I am inclined to recommend Venom for any cinema geeks who take joy indulging themselves in a movie so ineptly made that it becomes an unintentional comedy. Venom suffers from a multitude of issues and, to be quite fair, they are not all the responsibility of Fleischer alone. Avi Arad, the head producer, is equally, if not more so, at fault for the disrespect this fan-favorite character has received on the big screen. While Avi Arad may not be a household name even among the most ""cultured"" of cinema snobs, he is best known for the infamous disaster that was Spiderman 3. Many blamed Sam Raimi for attempting to introduce too many villains into the movie, but Arad himself takes the blame for that decision in an interview he did for Screen Rant in September (2018) while promoting Venom. Arad produced the latest (and now even more widely despised) incarnation in an attempt to repent for the mistakes made during that film. Arad, however, has never really understood the character of Venom himself and continues to place it into the hands of filmmakers who have no clue what to do with it either. The most glaring flaw, but perhaps the most forgivable, of this movie was the lack of any relation to Spider-Man. In an attempt to cash grab on their property, since Marvel was taking over with a refreshing look at Spider-Man, Sony executives seemed to sort through all the other Marvel characters they had the rights to and decided Venom was the one who could hold a standalone movie. After all, he had his own, individual comic run, didn't he? This ended up a great mistake, however, as Venom's appearance alone makes little to no sense without the existence of Spider-Man as a basis. Add to this the piss-poor CGI that garnered criticism before the film was even released, a script that sounds like it was written by an artificial intelligence that was fed every B-rate sci-fi movie ever made, an editing team that had no clue what they were supposed to be doing, and a miscast, misdirected collection of laughably bad performances and you get this dumpster fire of corporate incompetence. The first half-hour of this movie is a boring slog with a whiny, uninteresting protagonist, followed by nearly two more hours of hilarious mistake after mistake. While the cinematography and art direction were nothing horrifying, they were entirely average and bland. The characters felt plastic and unreal, as if they were straight off the pages of a comic, but in all the worst ways. They lacked motivation and the plot lacked any sensical direction, but somehow nobody stopped this from being released. It is an uncaring, uninspired, unforgivable piece of garbage that is better off forgotten.

Venom Letter Grade: F",2
Venom,"This movie is so not worth any of your time or money. The film was so badly edited I'm not sure if that was due to trying to get a PG-13 rating or the editor was just bad at piecing this film together. Tom Hardy was mos cast for this role and his acting was as bad as his ""Queens"" Accent. The jokes that were placed here and there didn't gain even a chuckle from the audience. The action scenes left me feeling like it was straight out of a power rangers episode on Fox. How do you mess up a car chase in San Francisco? It's made for car chase scenes. The back stories for Eddie Brock and Venom were so lame a fourth grader could come up with a better back story. Had they stuck with the idea of an R rated film then they could have done so much more also recast Tom Hardy.",2
Venom,Went to the cinema expecting more after the trailers but I was utterly disappointed. No need for the 3d glasses because the creature appears for a couple of minutes at the end of the movie. Don't waste your time!,2
Venom,"Go to see it just if you want to see Venom destroying things and fighting with a ""decent"" CGI, if you want to see something more, if you want to see Venom being a unstoppable villain that make you feel like he's a really bad dude, don't go to see it, you're going to finish the movie feeling sad and angry, like me in this moment. PD= Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock SUCKS.

Sony, stop doing things like this, PLEASE.",3
Venom,"As a huge fan of the superhero genre I was excited to see venom. The issue with Sony brought my expectations lower, early reviews came in and some were mixed. If you like mindless entertainment then this film is for you, the story itself is weak and unfortunately makes Venom the jokester. It seems like the writers chose to copy Deadpool's style of quippy jokes and they insert it into Venom. There are some moments that are good, example the chemistry that is barely shown between Venom and Eddie Brock shines, it had me engaged. Yet the film quickly reverts to it's terrible jokes, and crappy story. The film shines when it keeps focus on its core character and his struggle, if they kept a serious tone then we would have a good film. If they had a serious tone and better told story this film would be great. Sad to see a terrible comic book related film make its way onto the big screen.",3
Venom,"This movie is a complete mess, in fact the trailer is better than the entire movie, only good scenes at the ones in the trailer apart from that the entire movie revolves in Tom Hardy trying to act but instead of acting it makes you sleepy, in fact Venom could be a good replacement for the strongest sleeping pill ever.

I am very upset because of this poor cast and director that made a horrible movie the future of an amazing marvel character as Venom is almost doomed and most likely we will not see any other sequel, they had something amazing and they blew it.

First issue is the actor Tom Hardy does not have a clue about comic books 0 he does not care mainly he did it for his son and money so starting there you have an actor with 0 passion and that is not giving anything for this movie to be successful, rest of the cast is non existent, CGI is the worst ever, the director have to be demoted to direct 2 minutes shorts in you tube.

Last but not least they blew it again by not doing an R rated movie! Venom should be different to anyone else but the only thing they did was to do a very bad copy of a super hero movie from the '90.

Don't watch the movie or you will feel sick from all the Venom a bad move like this has.",3
Venom,"Meaningless goop-centric cgi scenes can't save this movie from mediocrity. First the obvious: a Spider-Man villain whose origin is dependent on the wall crawler who is VERY noticeably absent and who proves that he doesn't really deserve his own film. Without Spidey around, Venom's existence feels pointless, his origin bland and dull and the stakes never feel meaningful. Even his costume just looks like black vomit without the prominent white spider symbol that SHOULD be there. I've heard the movie called ""fun"" and it is if you turn your brain off. It's fun in the way a Rambo movie is fun; bad dialogue, flashy action, dumb plot, lots of special effects. Is it a good movie? No. Not even close. Does it do the character justice? Well, no. Without Spider-Man, how could it? Will the masses like it anyway? Probably.",3
Venom,"Sony messed up, real bad. They took a fun concept and turned it bad. They messed up a real cool villain and made him unwatchable. Not that Tom Hardy, hell he was the best part of the movie! He was super believable and I felt for him. He's a TV reporter who get fired for raising questions yo the evil guy and than comes in contact with the symbiote. And than there's Michelle Williams, no character, terrible acting, basically around as a love interest because if you don't have one of those, movie=bad. And than the villain, oh boy, the worst of the worst. He runs a corporation called ""Life corp' (great name) and really loves the symbiotes. He'll do anything to get those symbiotes. And than he merges with a symbiote, and wants to go to space??? What? Who saw this coming? The third act comes out of no where and I only realized it was the third act half way through the big fight. Also the movie cant decide if Venom's bad or good, just pick one and stick with it. I really wish that the movie went more in depth with Hardy's and Venom's relationship, because it's quite entertaining and fun, but just like the rest of the movie, it's rushed and glossed over and buried under other terrible scenes like: Venom telling us what his weaknesses is Hardy kissing the symbiote that is actually Williams (wait, what?) So yeah the characters: not entertaining (except for Hardy) Plot: rushed, already done better, and makes more sense Villain: boring, motivations change at random Camerawork and special effects: Not bad, actually quite good. The special effects are quite good at times. But we all know what this movie lacked, a Spiderman. A voice of reason, and it would be quite fun for the final battle to be between them.

So verdict: Wasted opportunities result in this loud rushed mess with a great performance from Tom Hardy",3
Venom,Venom: The acting was crude and the overall movie was boring. I do not recommend watching it in the big screen😳👎👎,3
Venom,I wanted this to be good even though all the warning signs pointed to the contrary. This is everything super hero movies shouldn't be. Disrespect the origin of the character. Script was horrible. Villain was lame and one dimensional. People were laughing in the theater at how bad it was. Should have given Sam raimi his own distinct venom film. What a waste,3
Venom,"CGI was AWESOME. Venom was awesome every single second he was on screen.

Other than that, the movie is quite terrible. It just doesn't commit to a style and, in my opinion, suffers for it.

Starts Sci-fi, then its typical origin comic book, then action-comedy with dark touches, then...

The humor, which is mostly dumb, mixed with dark jokes and some visual absurdism doesn't sound bad per se, but the reality is that they just don't nail a good enough amount of the jokes and Hardy's interpretation serves well some kind of jokes (when he is talking to Venom) and literally nothing else in the movie. Eddie Brooks is a just weird character.

Human characters: A realistic portrait of a relationship starts with Hardy's Brook character and his girlfriend. But after the first act, its just silly and all over the place. A philosophical villain didn't mantain the tone. At times he was a bigger than life thinker and crazy scientist, and at other times he was a typical sutarday cartoon villain.

The action is good, not great. It takes waaaaay too much time for fun things to start to happen.

It seems the first act was writen by somebody, then the middle part for another one, and ANOTHER one had to wrap the story and the arcs of the characters (and failed).

Honestly. Its a dissapointment.

Having said that: I don't think ""I wasted my money"", because its enjoyable and I want more. This one had a low budget and it was a bet. I'll support Sony. I want more.",3
Venom,"Like most people, I was very excited to see this. I saw on a Friday night and it was very disappointing The best thing about this film was Venom himself. He looked nice and threatening. The setting was OK. The bad out ways the good. Tom Hardy's character was very bland and boring and the villain wasn't the best, Sony had created much better villains in the past. It was mainly bland, forgettable and mainly confused with the tone. I actually recommend it though. I didn't enjoy it.",3
Venom,"Well to be frank I didn't liked the trailer but still went to watch today. It was an ok movie nothing great. Felt somewhat like Deadpool and even Spiderman in some parts. Nothing absolutely great, just an okayish movie for a one time watch. And please someone tell me where is all the police is USA? They never come at all. Lol.",3
Venom,The worst Superhero movie after the green guy. Terrible scenario. Only good things in the movie are the performers. Hope the 2nd never come.,3
Venom,"The only thing that I really liked was the soundtrack, even if I am not an Eminem fan. The movie was boring, so I relaxed my eyes ... a lot.",3
Venom,I'm giving this review four stars because I felt Tom Hardy delivered a phenomenal performance. This would be a much worse film if it weren't for him carrying such a weak movie. This is one of the WORST screenplays I've ever seen. Don't waste your money.,3
Venom,"Tom Hardy is the only good thing in this film however The plot, effects, other charcaters and no meaning to the film lacks so much that it bogs down to a low score",3
Venom,"Unfunny Comedy mixed with forgettable action sequences, the first 2/3 of the movie was boring and unwatchable, Venom was not portrayed well. all of these combined make a really disappointing movie for fans of Venom.",3
Venom,"A cringy movie... Venom isn't a menacing or cool character, but like some kind of Shrek, idk... Seems like Tom Hardy was also forcing himself to be funny. Whoever wrote the script sucks. Or he wrote it for children. Movie sucks.",3
Venom,"Not a huge fan of superhero movies but I enjoy trying to keep with with some Marvel lore from time to time between all the movies. I'm not well versed in spiderman/venom storylines from the comics so it's just a take on the movie from someone wanting to see a decent superhero flick with action and laughs.

This movie barely delivered on the laughs and couldn't even scrap together any memorable action scenes. Venom's awful storytelling definitely begins with the incoherent and messy script, with multiple plot lines leading nowhere and a villain that challenges the cheesiness of phase 1 marvel villains in blandness and forgettable lines.

Tom hardy as Eddie Brock seemed to be the only redeeming quality in this movie, using his natural charm and persona to interact with the venom creature in a meaningful way. However, his initial backstory as a news reporter was told in a matter of minutes at the beginning of the movie as a series of montages. Same thing with his relationship, quick few scenes and BOOM cut to 6 months later after everything goes downhill for Eddie. The movie spends roughly 30 minutes on 2 absolutely useless plot points involving symbiotes, adding nothing to the story and dragging it down even further.

The jokes were a hit and miss, but a lot of them just came down to 'the venom symbiote is talking funny in Eddie's head teehee!'. The comedy was one of the better aspects of the movie in terms of enjoyment.

The action? wow, it was downright handheld garbage for a good 80% of it. The character of venom looked pretty good most of the time, and big fans of him will be pleased to see his CGI on screen. The issue is 2 of the bigger fights involving venom fighting the villain and his goons of course take place at night and are barely lit enough to gain a coherent visual on the action. Venom absorbs heaps of bullets and damage and leaves Eddie without a scratch, yippee. The final fight played basically like Black Panther's final fight in terms of being a forgettable, dimly lit mess with no memorable action.

I'll try not to spoil anything, but the movie basically boils down to ' bad man wants bad thing to happen to earth, but good man who make past mistake try to stop bad man because he bad!'. No subtle underlying themes or messages. I'm not asking for Kubrick levels of subliminal messaging, but the story had no substance to offer whatsoever, except for a hamfisted relationship that's been played out to ensure the audience connects romantically to the movie, which of course adds nothing to the already barren story.",3
Venom,1 Star for Venoms look 2 Stars for humour 3 Stars for Tom Hardy being a good sport for dealing with this terrible script,3
Venom,"Really wanted to love this movie as the ensemble cast are all excellent actors.... But the action scenes were messy as you can tell who's who (like Transformers, but worse) and some of the speech is laughable (the ""I'm kind of a loser"" part actually cracked me up).

It's ok to make commercially viable movies for the mainstream - just don't do it on the back of making the trailer looking dark and edgy! I just felt ripped off because of this.",3
Venom,"In my opinion the best part of this movie was the CGI and the few comedic moments that occurred. The plot was thin. The acting was marginal (Tom Hardy was the exception; only reason I didn't cut it short), and the overall feel seemed amateur. To me a waste of time.",3
Venom,Here is another example of yet another Marvel character that Sony has ruined! When will we finally take Marvel privileges away from Sony? Maybe we will never learn,3
Venom,"Tom Hardy should avoid comedy at all costs. Tom Hardy should avoid being casual. There is nothing more UNfunny and awkward than Tom Hardy in this ""movie"".

Everything about this movie is awkward. The first act intro and set up, the endless cliches, the contrived dialogue, the special effects circa 1998... it just never stops, and it seems like it never stops.

I had very low expectations and WAS so disappointed. I feel embarrassed for everyone who worked on this movie. This is not venom in my voice, this move is poison for your mind.

This move pushes the overpopulation myth and climate change while consuming how much resources to make it? Hypocrites and bad ""filmmakers"".

Endless American wars, corrupt American politicians, bankrupt American healthcare, AND lousy American movies and propaganda. When is America gonna be great again?

Bad movie, bad. So bad.

P.S. Also, he's not very smart for an investigative independent journalist.

P.P.S. ""A Simple Favour"" is a clever funny thriller I can recommend.",3
Venom,"Weak plot with no direction. Tom Hardy looked unguided. The pretentious voice is highly unnecessary. Horrible CGI, felt like I'm watching The Terminator from 3 decades ago",3
Venom,"This was one of the poorest, most awful films I've seen in years. I blame the director and whomever hired this mess of actors. It was just a disaster, so disappointing.",3
Venom,When you desperately miss Nicholas Cage something is very wrong.,3
Venom,"For me, personally, I think Venom is a brutal and gruesome anti-hero. This movie is nothing but a parody of what was once a pretty merciless symbiote. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hardy is great in his double performance, Riz Ahmed has obviously a fun time playing the bad guy and every other actor and actress knew what movie they were doing. I was disappointed that the movie was more of a comedy than what I was expecting. Not even being r-rated, Venom's not even scratching on the surface of what would have been possible in terms of violence.

Riot/Riz Ahmed, the bad guy, is not really getting the depth he would've needed to stay in my head at least 1 hour after finishing the movie due to the movies length. And don't get me started on the cgi-fight at the end of the overall cgi - horrible!

Overall: A rushed plot/character writing, Venom is a joke, a missing r-rating and poor cgi.",4
Venom,"It's good but we need to make a movie for every single comic book character. There are characters that can't appear alone as maybe venom? what was the idea of the movie from the first place? the movie started slow and started to build a story in the first half and it was like a romantic movie. the directing was too bad and the sreen was too dark that i couldn't see a thing. the second half was too rushed and villian appeared for too short time and was too bad not evil or strong enough as they said he didn't take it's time. ""venom"" turned good easily without any responsible reason it was too silly like a childish animation movie. i liked many things as of course tom hardy some scences but the characters and the directing and the sstory wasn't good enough didn't like it. i don't think venom could be without spider man",4
Venom,"Acting so so (I didn't find Tom Hardy funny, didn't really get the interest of the Ann character, the villain is not scary!)

Special effects not fantastic but OK.

The weakest point is the forced, over cliche plot! Sometimes the basics are just fine but the story needs to built up... here everything seems forced and most parts are not credible.",4
Venom,"I love Tom Hardy but not today.

He's still a great actor but this movie took him down with it.

Really tired of these super hero movies trying to incorporate way too many elements.

Venom went from an E.T beast to a domestic pet. I'm really confused as whether the production wants me to fear him or be his BFF.

And the reactions among the characters don't even make sense.

Ultimately, this felt too generic and there were no exciting parts for me.

The four stars are purely for Tom and Eminem's song.

SAD. Look what capitalism has done to the entertainment industry.",4
Venom,"Solo was a mildly fun but forgetable movie. Venom is fun at times but ends up leaving you wondering how much better this could have been. Tom Hardy is probably the only one who stands out at all, trying his best to make this work. The others aren't bad actors at all. Their parts are just so two-dimensional that there's nothing to work with. The love of his life drops him and moves onto another live-in boyfriend after one incident despite having been there through much worse with Brock in NY. The villain's actions based on his motivation make no sense. Finally, despite being a major Spider-Man villain, there's absolutely no connection to the webcrawler right down to completely changing Venom's origin story. There's the feel that Sony & Disney would like for this to be a part of the MCU (there's even the obligatory Stan Lee sighting and the credit scene involving another big Spider-Man nemesis) but it still divorces itself from everything else MCU. This is the kind of product I would expect from DC and not Marvel...and yes, while it's Sony they go to great trouble to remind us multiple times this is in association with Marvel.",4
Venom,"Film Review: Venom (NO SPOILERS)

I'll skip going over the premise because everyone knows what it's about

This movie was really that bad. I mean it's not a Batman and Robin kinda bad but it is just a passable unnecessary film.

I heard a lot of people were saying this film isn't as bad as critics said it is but I ended up agreeing with what the critics said.

I didn't find any redeeming quality in it. This film wastes too much time to establish what it needs to. They spend nearly an hour going over stuff that could have been over with in the opening fifteen to twenty minutes.

There's too much of Eddie Brock and too less of Venom. I found Eddie Brock to be a very one dimensional paper thin protagonist. Tom Hardy was just OKAY in terms of acting. I don't know why people are praising him so much.

Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed are totally miscast in their roles. Not only that, their characters are very one dimensional too. All characters in this film are one dimensional except for the Venom symbiote itself which was intriguing and had a few funny lines.

There are lot of unnecessary cringe-y attempts at comedy in this film. The only time it was kinda working was when Eddie and Venom had a conversation. The comedic tone clashed with the supposed dark tone of the film. Tonally, this was a mess. What is this film trying to be? A nicolas cage style comedy? A dark and gritty monster film?. It just ended up being a generic #1000 blockbuster action film you'd usually see The Rock in minus Rock's charisma.

A generic story is no problem if you can find new ways of telling your story. Venom follows the same pattern you'd see in any origin story except it takes too long before anything interesting happens and when something remotely interesting occurs, you realize the film is about to end

The action scenes felt incoherent and hard to follow at times. And if you have seen the clips and the trailers, you have seen pretty much all the decent sequences.

By the time I got near the end, I realized at least there's at least a CGI filled finale which is always cool to see but who gives the damn when the rest of the film does a piss poor job of building up to it. And the ending was very quick and abrupt.

This was a very unnecessary quick cash grab by Sony. Venom is a cool bad ass character and his dynamic with Eddie is interesting but Eddie himself is very dull.

It sets up a sequel and I kinda want to see the sequel instead of this film. I honestly think they should have avoided doing an origin story when it's this simple. We didn't need this film. It was totally unnecessary and forgettable. They should have followed whatever they are gonna do in the sequel for part one instead of making this film.

If you were looking forward to this film, maybe you should see it instead of letting my review ruin your anticipation but this is my opinion on the film. But I don't think this film is worth your money. You deserve better. I don't know what people saw in this film that made some people say ""It is really good"" but if you liked it, good for you.

Suicide Squad had some redeeming quality and BvS was quite good compared to this. Most mediocre films like Kong Skull Island etc etc do. This film? there's barely any redeeming quality about it.

Final Rating: 4.4",4
Venom,"Let me start assuring you, I am always a Tom Hardy fan. As a performer, he brings an uncommon realism to films that are lucky enough to have him. His voice is one of the most imitated among modern actors. He serves as a vocal chameleon. But I took issue with his latest movie Venom.

The story was entertaining and I feel I got my money's worth. Yet, the plot was so riddled with holes that I could not help but feel a little insulted. In terms of character progression, Eddie Brock and hi symbiote counterpart develop too slowly at first and then assume a sudden change of heart. The film was 80 percent backstory, 10 percent climax, and 10 percent credits. At other times, it felt as though the screenwriter meant to be humorous while the director wanted a darker tale. Tom Hardy's voice also bounced around from soft Bane to squeaky New Yorker.

Of course, it is only fair that I offer some advice to pair with my scrutiny. Venom's producers need to look at Deadpool for inspiration. Deadpool uses humor to such a degree that the audience laughingly overlooks plot holes and deus ex machina devices. Venom needs not take itself too seriously in the next installment.

After all, I had a good time in the theatre. I likely would not pay to see it again, but I don't regret going in the first place.",4
Venom,"Venom is finely crafted - crafted to avoid every possible interesting dialogue, and designed without audience members in mind. This feat appears to have been accomplished without a copy editor or, infact, an acomplished script writer.

The tale was remarkable - it ignored the interesting directions the movie could have gone in, instead, including a faux 'evil' villain with kamikaze drones who's explosive powers seem to be inversely proportional with their proximity to Tom Hardy.

The movie features a background of scientists who's moral code seems lacklustre at best, and at worst taken directly from the mantra of Mengele. This, surprisingly, goes wrong.

Characters have a knack for receiving critical information just in time to prevent the 'plot' from derailing. This occurs so regularly, that if one doesn't pay attention, they might just beleive that all characters in the universe are somehow linked by mystical directing powers. They're not. The direction was awful.

The CG was pretty good though. Worth a watch, but also worth sleeping through. You won't miss anything.",4
Venom,"When the trailers were coming out for Venom I couldn't help but be excited, I wanted to see this film be its own thing like dead-pool did but with Venom as the lethal protector.

This film has aspects that have a lot of potential such as the back and forth between Eddie and Venom, however we don't get much of that in favour of the film giving us more of Eddie and his love interest. Which is a shame as Venom and Eddie have a interesting dynamic in the comics, but in here we have Venom used more for comedy relief in the film than anything else, skipping over most of the character development.

The story itself has no pacing issues but its just so dull and a ton of scenes just feel so pointless to the story leaving it feeling like filler.

What was a big disappointment however were the action scenes, the venom tentacles that you see in the trailer just look very cheesy and weird. Venom only has a couple of fight scenes which are just OK which is a shame when you have a power house like venom in your film, plus they take place at night which makes it very hard to see as Venom is basically fully black.

Tom Hardy was good.",4
Venom,"This movie was a total missfire for Sony. They took a great character and turned it into ""a turd in the wind"". Tom Hardy sounded like he wanted to give a good performance but the direction is so bad I don't think anyone could pull it off. Riz Ahmed was terrible as the villain. He was bland and stupid and he claims he cares about life and the survival of the human race but his experiments kill people.

Michelle Williams is such a good actress and she had nothing to work with in this movie. We see Eddie and Anne's relationship for 10 minutes and then they break up and it feels fake because we've had no time to show that these people loved eachother. Anne Weying has nothing to do but whine and moan and only at the end does she become useful when she ""fight's ugly"".

This movie isn't all bad however as Venom is the one character done right. His back and forth with Eddie is great and he really gives this movie a light hearted dark comedy tone. He is the one character who feels truly heroic as he chooses to help the human race instead of taking it over.

Riot was stupid in the movie. He stays latched onto an old woman for 6 months which is totally ridiculous and then he only becomes relevant in the third act. When he does come out he is great and his fight with Venom is fun albeit bogged down by CGI.

Overall, this is a mess of a movie. I won't be watching it again in theatres but I will buy it when it comes out because it is fun to watch.",4
Venom,"When I went to see this movie I was worried I might waste time and alas I cannot easy your mind a little. The movie is just as bad as many critics have been reporting. Before I start I want to say that the only the reason I gave the movie a more than three-out-of-ten rating are considerable acting efforts of Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed who raise the movie's quality from completely unwatchable to at least a little entertaining. I believe we have been spoiled by Marvel with many great movies over the years. This one is a certain misfire. It lacks the stability and excitement we usually find in a Marvel production and it mostly lives off of it's great acting performances. The movie starts with a scene of a crashing space ship. On board this space ship are the so called ""Symbionites"" (which by the terms definition is wrong). These creatures search a host and essentially connect with them so they can survive. That is exactly what happens to investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy). The Symbiote connecting to him is called Venom and once the two find each other the wreaking havoc starts. This is a very short description of the plot of the movie and basically that is all that you have to know. There is rarely something exciting happening in Venom. Before we get to the aforementioned connection between man and alien we have to wait a bout an hour. Before that there is a fairly boring plot that explains next to nothing about the creatures or the reason they are on earth. Unfortunately the second hour is not much more interesting than the first one. There a few well made scenes when Eddie fights the bad guys from the so called Life Coporation. But that is most of the action you get. This year we have seen a few action with many great chases. The best by far is the motorcycle chase in Mission Impossible: Fallout. There is a motorcycle chase in the second half of the movie as well but is so dull it make Tom Cruise cry in shame. A thing that Marvel usually does particularly well is choosing their villains. This time however it was a swing and a miss. While Riz Ahemds villain Carlton Drake is a complete ass he is neither threatening nor scary. In most Marvel movies while you can relate to the villain you still hate them. This is not the case here mostly due to the fact that Venom is a kind of villain himself and seems ay more threatening than Drake. While the action scenes are a positive aspect of the movie there is one in particular that fails to hold up the standard. In the end of the movie, when Venom fights another Symbionite, the fight is utterly boring. I have never seen a fight in a movie as bad as this one in all my life. Apart from the scene just taking three minutes, instead of the usual ten, there also is a total lack of creativity. Often in this kind of movies the final fight sequence offers us some creative new ways to make the scene more exciting. This is not the case here. The two participants just hit each other a few times and then before the fight even really started it is done. It simply was a complete disappointment. The thing that surprised me the most however was the lack of humor in this movie. Granted Venom is a dark character and it hard to laugh about man-eating, parasitic alien that threatens to wipe out humanity but usually Marvel still managed to make the audience chuckle. In Venom there is a complete lack of humor and when the movie tries to be funny it usually just feels more awkward than funny. But luckily Venom isn't all bad. There were some good choices that Marvel made. Those choices were mostly made in the casting department. Hiring three respected and popular actors was a good choice. The most exciting performance in the movie was of course the one by Michelle Williams. She is a widely under appreciated actress and one of the best of our time. I cannot remember the last time she had to work so hard to make her character likable and authentic. But nevertheless she does it perfectly. Williams had a difficult job making an utterly uninteresting character interesting enough so we care about her. She managed to hold her ground against a totally screwed up script and steals every scene she's in. Riz Ahmed had it a little easier. While his bad guy Carlton Drake is not as threatening and unlikable as he should have been Ahmed still manages to bring out the ass persona in the character. Other than his two co-stars Hardy seems lost in the role. But while he does his best in this thankless role what he does is neither here nor there and his talent is wasted in this film. We get flashes of his considerable acting skills in the beginning of the movie but the longer the movie goes the more lost and bored Hardy seems to be. One thing that I was pleasantly surprised about was some of the production design. The Life Corporation head quarters were designed with precision and an idea. They look so authentic that one might think the set actually existed somewhere in the world. I also enjoyed some beautiful shots of the San Francisco skyline and harbor. In conclusion I must say that Venom is a complete crap fest that makes too many bad choices for it to be a good movie. If you plan to spend money on seeing it, I strongly advise you not top do it. It's not worth it. This one of those movies that you will catch on cable some day and that you will forget about as soon as you leave the couch.",4
Venom,"The build up was rubbish, no background to the whole thing so u just have to make your own assumptions, they tried to fit a little bit of drama in their but failed miserably. The action wasn't great also, you don't really know what are the specific powers of Venom, once he's unstoppable and then he gets hit by a car.. The only positive thing is it's pretty funny.. and yea tom hardy carried this movie",4
Venom,"I had fun watching this movie but the only reason i gave it a 4/10 is because of Venom reason not to the attack the planet Earth. He turned against his kind for the simple reason he ""liked"" eddy...",4
Venom,Cheesy writing didn't help Hardy make the character all it could be. I was really looking forward to this film based on the trailers... unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. When the Venom voice began speaking from with Hardy's character the movie officially lost me.,4
Venom,"The GOOD reviews must be coming from ASIA which is obviously who produced this movie The fact they chose a leading support actor that's from Pakistan only adds to the total IMBALANCE of this film. Nothing fits. Nothing is smooth, and it has no chemistry. Within minutes you realize something is very OFF. What's 'off' (in my opinion) is that entertainment STYLE and sense of humor does not always translate through to people from different countries and cultures. What you have here is, a fair attempt at an 'alien on earth' drama with a great leading man, trying his very best to work with a sub standard script, which includes humor that North American audiences will NOT find funny (just horribly corny) During the last part of the movie I just started surfing the net, because it was too predictable (and just cheap) Ultimately the villains in this film reach out and grab you JUST LIKE GODZILLA and it's enemy, (what-ever-its-name-was.) If you WANT to LIKE this movie, I suggest you have a few alcoholic beverages first. LASTLY, don't think I'm biased or anything. I've watched movies with nothing but subtitles and loved them INCLUDING some Jackie Chan ones that barely got shown in North America. This poor movie VENOM, just doesn't measure up. Maybe the target audience is PG 13 and I'm all wrong?",4
Venom,"This movie wasn't AWFUL. But I wouldn't say it's Marvel's best. I'm not very educated in the history of the character's and whatnot. So this is all coming from my knowledge from the movies and such. I will start with the positives, because that's fun! I thought that the fight scenes were well choreographed, for the most part. I thought that Tom Hardy as Eddie could have been better performed, he could have been great if it weren't for some of his stylistic choices (or it might have been the director, I don't know!) And here' s where I start the negatives... I didn't think it was very ""entertaining"" how Tom portrayed Eddie. He was very casual and upbeat but it a way that was way too cheesy and would be seen as bad acting. Sometimes that's ok, but only if it's in the right context and environment (that's when it can turn into good comedy, which this clearly was not!). Eddie's strange character was put into situations were the people around him didn't react or play off his attitudes, that made it so that I would feel uncomfortable watching it instead of the characters around him feeling uncomfortable, which something that can be easily achieved if you write good character interactions! I did not feel a single thing for any of the characters because there wasn't enough content or information that showed how each of these people are with each other. One scene (or multiple even) with cheesy and awful dialogue won't cut it so I can feel something for them. The simple rule of ""Show, Don't Tell"" clearly lacks in a lot of scenes. I can't believe that two characters love each other just because they say it, you need to put in some steaks to a simple feeling or emotions so the audience can see! But you know, opinions are subjective. If you enjoyed this, good for you. But I do think it is unfair to label this movie anything higher than an 8 and anything lower than a 5. Sometimes opinions stop us from really seeing that true quality of a movie. I did not enjoy Venom. I will not be seeing it again. But I will give credit where credit is due. This movie was good enough to deserve a hard earned 6!",4
Venom,I throuly enjoyed the movie. Also I liked the explaination on the origins.,4
Venom,"Oh boy where do I begin. Let's start with me wondering why this has a 7/10 right now. There are so many things about this movie that bring it down that I'm wondering if the people who rate it 9 or 10 out of 10 saw the same movie I did. Let's start with the script. Its laughably bad at times (the dialogue is borderline funny), and there are so many cliches (theres even a giant monster fight on a rocket at the end). Almost all the acting is poor to bad, especially Riz Ahmed who I can only describe as Elon Musk but a stereotypical Mavel villain.

The only good piece of acting is Tom Hardy (because hes Tom Hardy), but even then I hope he doesnt think Americans sound like that. The only reason I give this a 4 instead of a 2 or 3 is because the banter between Venom and Eddie Brock is genuinely entertaining most of the time, and theres a couple of good action scenes.

However, it's really not worth the 10 or 11 bucks you gotta pay to see it. If you wanna watch it, just wait until you can rent it for 3 bucks.",4
Venom,"I was very much into Venom back in the old Todd McFarlane days. This Hollywood take on the character was waaay to weak, and I don't think the director did a very good job of bringing Tom Hardy forth as Venom. He made it too goofy, where it should have dark and violent. There is violence, but it's too restricted, and a character like Venom calls for some R-rated gore. I wonder how they will deal with Carnage, as that guy is pure ultraviolence. As for entertainment-factor, I really tried to like it, but found myself bored and looking at the clock a bit too often. A few good ideas, but overall it was just too weak. And don't get me started on that Paw Patrol CGI. Time to step up the game, FX-people of Hollywood!!",4
Venom,"Venom is set to be the first movie in the Sony's Universe of Marvel Characters and a first standalone Spider-Man villain movie. The story of the film is based on the Venom: Lethal Protector(1993) comic book, but many things from it was cut out to make a much more realistic story introducing the character. Journalist Eddie Brock is trying to take down Carlton Drake, the notorious and brilliant founder of the Life Foundation, who won't stop at anything to achieve his goal, even if it means to sacrifice people. While investigating one of Drake's experiments, Eddie's body merges with the alien symbiote Venom - leaving him with superhuman strength and power.

Even though the film has a PG-13 rating, watching it makes you wonder whether the adult rating was intended in the first place, because some scenes draw a really thin line between the two ratings. Comic book lovers won't be disappointed with the look of symbiotes and some action scenes are impressive and interesting to follow. Also, the dark humor and Eddies interaction with Venom must be pointed out. Venom is not just a black costume with powers, it's a different personality living in the head and taking care of the host. What makes it special is that Tom Hardy made the voice of Venom and their conversation feels real due to pre-recorded voice over which was used on set.

Unfortunately, nothing much can be added to the advantages of the film above. The film has many problems starting with a poor script and ending with a temp of storytelling. Characters are written to be plain, without any depth and development. Even understanding the writers idea to prepare the viewer for symbiote appear, first act of the film some may find boring and excessive.",4
Venom,"The film is allright if you are not a fan of the comics. but why is Brock not a bad guy like he allways is. We all know that origin storys slightly changes in a movie , but this is a complete new one. You introduce 2 children of Venom but not the making of them. The CGI is bad for a movie thats from 2018. But all bad things aside , i really love the voice of Venom.",4
Venom,Not really venom just another average film that feels like it was wrote in 1999! Ignore the numptys giving this a 10/10 they obviously are just muppets desperately trying to rebel against the MCU.,4
Venom,"If you played this against the Eric Bana Hulk movie in a double-bill the only difference would be the slightly better CGI, and within that 'slightly' is the keyword. Even Tom Hardy's scizophrenic portrayal cant rescue the terrible script and no-one else is worth watching.",4
Venom,"I watched this movie with the expectations of a low-rated marvel/superhero movie, knowing the movie received masses of negative reviews.

At this point I have watched lots of movies, and lots of superhero movies, and I can say this is truly a bad movie. This movie had no creativity, no charisma, nothing that felt new or special or anything really. The visuals of the beast were definitely well made but other than that I can't believe this movie had blockbuster money.

The plot in itself was terrible. This movie was not thought through like nowadays blockbusters are. The thirty-something guy with the good life, success, good wife, wants to do the right thing but eh there is is this bad evil corporation that is recognized and the simple fact of questioning them made him lose his job, and then his wife-to-be dump him and get herself a new doctor bf within like what, a week? This is cliche, way too similar to the amazing spider-man (same director btw), in terms of giga bio-company being led by an evil CEO.

This movie is also the proof that a good actor always needs a good character to actually perform. Because really, Tom Hardy was okay at best, it was just weird and we couldn't really see or feel anything in the character, her ex-gf and his new boyfriend were even worse, uncomfortable to watch.

Some people critique the critiques, but if this movie had received good reviews, I really would have lost hope in any movie evaluations. The direction and production of this movie took no risk at all, this movie was plain, and this is why blockbusters have bad reputations, because there are too many movies like this one; Lots of money, nice visuals, big-name actors, but no risks, no creativity, no new feelings, this is recycling.

Compare this to recent Marvels and this is kid game. The acting, the lines, the interactions between characters and even the plot at this point sounded like a 2005 movie, where the simple fact of having incredible computer effects could give an amazing movie, but no, 2018, we've seen this thousands of time, you actually needs some thinking to produce a good movie. I am not saying you cannot enjoy it, because anyone can enjoy any movie at this point, but this is mediocre filmmaking.",4
Venom,Movie was great in the theater... The entire opening scene is gone from the DVD release. Won't be buying it based on that.,4
Warcraft,"The most dissapointing videi game adoption ti film ever and then i have been an hardcore fan of warcraft there is nothing in this movie off the good Old warcraft fail in the director and writer, they could not been warcraft fans ... then they Would never puck the most boring theme ""Orcs"" if they just focused on arthas and lich king elfs and undead sylvanas the movies would succed. People say video game adoptions is hard on movies but i say no this one is actually hard to fail this hard u just need to be an warcraft fan and follow the succeded games.",1
Warcraft,"As far as the plot goes, it wasn't the same plot as in the game. It was supposed to be Warlords of Draenor, not the original Warcraft. Too many Illuminati and evil Freemason symbols in the movie, aren't hard to notice.

Warlordsof Draenor was 'interesting', to me but not worthy of a movie. If you want to make a good movie, they need to do Grand Theft Auto. I haven't played this game in a year, it's going down the tubes. The 'Legion' game that will be soon released will not be played by me until I hear people saying they really like it. An Orc being friends with a Human? Wouldn't happen on my server. And where were the Gnomes? I play a pink haired midget Gnome called Kickhere. They had Blood elves, but in the real game, those are Gay guys. Totally overrated review. Blizz needs to stop making movies, and try harder on making a better game.",1
Warcraft,"I just watched it in IMAX 3D and was continuously amazed at the visuals and grand scenes this movie has to offer, superb sound and good acting as well. I highly recommend this movie just for that, it's a visual marvel, and, as someone who's never played the game, I didn't feel too lost on what was happening, which was good. I was correct to give it a chance.

However it's filled with plot holes and it ends with one that's massively disappointing, nearly ruined the whole movie for me; for inexplicable reasons, a certain someone told someone else to do something unreasonable and drastic for no reason whatsoever. And even more disappointingly - they did. This is a case where in attempt to lure the viewer in suspense for the next movie the writer/s instead ruined the ending of this one, and killed any positive feelings I had for certain characters, cheaply. I was enjoying myself trough most of the movie, but after that ending, I didn't feel good as we left the cinema. I spoke with my friends who saw it with me - nobody liked the ending and everybody felt cheated as an otherwise good movie suddenly stopped making sense near the end for the sake of plot twists and a ""to be continued"" moment.

Not happy with the cheap ending ""twist"" at all, but I still recommend watching this movie for what it has to offer visually.",1
Warcraft,"I was a Warcraft and World Of Warcraft player and i'm sad too see what they have done with this movie.... 1.No character development. 2.The story felt rushed. 3.CGI not good not bad. 4.Dialog was poorly written. 5.Short and slow battles with no real excitement. 6.The actors were not right for this movie (the looks, the acting, outfits just nothing) 7.A lot of poetry like story The list goes on and on. It was just sad to watch a wonderful game like this with such a wonderful story to be portrayed like this as if they haven't seen ''Lord Of The Rings'', Vikings or even Game Of Thrones. At least i got nostalgic and started playing World Of Warcraft Classic again :). FOR THE ALIANCE!",1
Warcraft,"Absolutely horrible. the only redeeming quality is some good CGI on the orc. Other than that EVERYTHING was terrible. this was like mortal kombat with better CGI. THE WORST DIALOGUE EVER. And the awful acting made the horrible dialogue sound even worse. there were so many times when the dialogue didn't even make sense. One person would say something, then the other person would respond in a way that has nothing to do with what the first person said. For example, ""Where are we going"" ... ""We must fight as one"" (end scene). If you don't fully pay attention you may let it slide. But if you do, you will notice the conversation does not flow at all like any conversation should. They just say what the movie wants them to say.

Another problem is that this movie tried to be primarily story-based. A movie like this really should have been a fun popcorn flick with good action and some funny banter between the characters. Instead, they tried to make this complex story that was so scattered and all over the place. And I didn't care about any of it. Why? Because it was useless. Why? Because the characters were useless. I didn't like any of them except the main orc character, and barely. All of the humans were pointless. So much bad acting.

I didn't even get to the worst part of the acting. IMO, Paula Patton is the worst popular actress in hollywood today. I have noticed this in many of her past movies. She makes the same face for everything. She furrows her brow, that's it. Regardless of the emotion, it's that face. All her lines sounded soooooo awkward. Her romance was SOOOOO AWKWARD. Completely forced. I think she also made me like Mission Impossible 4 less, and she was terrible in 2 Guns and Deja Vu.

Other than all the terrible things in the movie, I figured it would at least have some good war scenes, since it's called WARcraft. Nope. Not one action scene stood out to me. And there were barely any of them. This movie was SO boring. I kept thinking, can we please get this moving along. But no, the story... we need more story (sarcasm). The only cool scenes were the magic ones.

Adam was right on this one. I am baffled that so many users liked this movie. I thought maybe it was just a movie for the fans, but I don't even feel like there was that much from the games. plus even if it's for the fans, it wasn't entertaining at all. It was so bland and typical (1 viewing)",1
Warcraft,"Is there a plot? Are they acting or just going through the motions to get a cheque?

This is the worst film I have ever tried to watch. Ridiculous rubber masks, complete with fangs that look as false as Trump's natural tan. Action-less action scenes, unintelligible dialogue, dreadful editing are all features of how you will waste your time watching this film.",1
Warcraft,"I really would rate this -1000 if i could.

If you in any way know anything about Warcraft novels, games, and the world of Warcraft in general, than set yourself up for the most disappointing movie portraying anything you already know about its' title.

It's unbelievably disappointing to trust such a movie title to an amateur director who has directed four movies in his entire ""career""; someone who probably tried so hard yet failed so miserably. I think this has been the biggest mistake Blizzard has ever done and will ever do.

I don't even think this director ever watched a Blizzard Cinematic in his life. Probably he has done so after this major nonsense, missing every detail possible, and i'm not even talking about production. This really feels like some parody movie, which focuses solely on sentimental aspect of Warcraft, and there can't be any sentimental stuff in a movie called WAR-CRAFT. I CAN'T f believe i saw a KISS. Are you kidding me????????????

I can write two days constantly without even stopping a single minute, and tell you how much this, i cannot even call it a movie anymore, su---. I cannot even compare it to any other failures in the movie industry that i know of. This is definitely the worst i've seen on screen. Can't get any worse than this.",1
Warcraft,"Do you remember about the war between Orcs and humans? I don't. Maybe it took place when I was away on vacation, I had a long vacation on Khutungu, my own pink planet, I was not on Azeroth for a few years. And why they have fangs so big and ugly, no dentists there on their planet? OK, I'm just kidding, I'm an Orc myself and I was a stillborn too. And the great Chief-Wizard instilled in my navel the soul of a cockroach and the soul of a mouse, to bring me back to life, just to write you this review. First of all, I got to tell you that I was The Guardian of the S..t myself so, I can surely smell one, especially when it comes from the dark forces. The dark forces of the cinema, what did you thought? You'll do the right thing if you'll not watch this film but, if however you're stubborn to see it, take some precautions, make your lobotomy surgery first. One last thing, I used to ride a wolf myself when I was younger but, someday, I was terribly hungry and I ate that wolf. From that day, I only take the bus.",1
Warcraft,"First and foremost I am not a gamer of Warcraft. I watched the movie with no preconceptions.

It didn't live up to the hype.

The story is a mess. A lot of things are happening without being explained why. The movie never made me care about any of the characters. The Orc wizard is the only character that seems pretty interesting. He can definitely get a career out of nursing, saving dead babies.

Halfway through the movie, a young lad got butchered by an Orc. Sad music was playing. That scene is supposed to be emotional, right? But I just didn't care. Lad, that is what you get for playing hero. Duncan Jones, you want the audience to feel sad, right? Make us care first!

Maybe this movie caters to gamers of Warcraft only.",1
Warcraft,"What the f*****g f**k what that piece of s**t????! It has been 12 years (almost) since WoW was released and it took the players about 5 seconds to realize ""this would make an awesome movie"" and this is what you give us?????!!! I was late to the party, mid 2015 and only played for about a year and a half so i'm sure i missed a lot of name and history references, but for f**k sake where are the gaming references??? This piece of steaming garbage plays like a daytime-B-fantasy-TV-show. Where are the classes? Where are the races? Where's the third person view? where are the awesome pieces of armor (plastic is not a thing in the game) and cloth? Where are the muscles and where are the females?? You might say ""oh, but this is only a build-up for the sequels"" but sequels are f*****g EARNED!!! This pile of excrement (not for lack of good talent) would have been embarrassing if released in 2003. With all the amazing concept art and cinematic blizzard and fans have produced over the last 2 decades, there are no excuses for making a single frame of this film seem mundane. It took me 1 minute to think ""what the hell..?"" and that feeling only grew stronger for each minute. This could (AND SHOULD) have been a milestone for fantasy and game adaptation that would blow the LOTR-films in to the last century, but no. What we got was a cold slap in the groin and some dude probably making a lot of money of the name, adding Transformers hahaha-moments that made me want to gauge my eyes out with a dagger. Any kind of dagger. A whole bunch of people should be ashamed of themselves. Very ashamed. Positive? Some of the orcs where OK, CGI speaking. Sheep scene was amazing. Negative? This being released for everyone to see. FFS... (note: i know Warcraft has been around longer than WoW, but come on, WoW what we build most of our expectations on)",1
Warcraft,"What's the deal with the tusks? Any species which has advanced to the point of speech, development of tools, etc. would have shed any detrimental or useless physiological feature. The tusks were quite simply beyond idiotic- how did these things drink a glass of water? Beyond that, the ""acting"" was horrible, the story simple-minded, plots holes too many to count, so many ripoffs of the Vikings series (shield walls, really) poor CGI- all over-presented in a 2+ hour movie which could have been easily done in 90 minutes.

This is typical of the poor quality movies now regularly passed off as entertainment. It's a shame this is what movie-making has come to.",1
Warcraft,"In 2000, someone had the ""fantastic"" idea of creating a ""Dungeons and Dragons"" movie.

It was a travesty. Such a travesty, in fact, that no one has spoken of making anything similar since. It got close to destroying the career of Jeremy Irons and every other ""actor"" and ""actress"" involved in that steaming pile of bovine fecal matter has been forever tarnished by their association therewith, and have failed to make it in Hollywood.

And then came Warcraft.

A worthy successor in terms of sheer, utter awfulness. Ten minutes in, I was laughing at how bad it was. IF I had paid money in the cinema to see this talentless piece of unspeakable awfulness, I would have walked out and re-considered paying for movie-tickets for a while. I'd have felt -robbed-.

The acting is hammy, non-existent or just plain bad. The sets are ridiculously awful, to the point of people riding past green-screen so poorly executed that you can SEE where the plastic and cardboard trees stop and the green-screen begins. Close-ups of armour reveals that it seems to be painted by a blindfolded four-year-old. The King's helmet is so poorly fitting he can barely look out of it, and it tends to -not- -turn- when he turns his head inside it. The fight scenes are just plain dreadful, with anyone NOT CGI, having had obvious trouble with where to hit the markers that the orks would later replace, to the point of not following through on their attacks or flailing aimlessly in the air.

Medivh is criminal in his ridiculousness.

Look ... Warcraft is a series of games that never took itself particularly seriously. The jokes were plentiful ... anyone who played them probably had fun multi-clicking on any unit on the map to eventually have them flip out and badmouth you for bothering them. The sheer, unadulterated silliness of it all permeats the games.

But the movie has none of it. It tries to take itself seriously and fails -miserably- on every -single- count. Within the first fifteen minutes, you have to be able to tell just under twenty -named- characters apart and make sense of their motivations and place within the story.

The only character which comes close to believability for fans of the games, is Gul'dan, who is as vicious and nasty as one could hope for. Except of course, when he delivers a stillborn baby and promptly saves its life. Oh ... oops. Or his voice. Good heavens, his -voice-. Weedy little sniveling git that they made him. He could have been an overgrown goblin, instead of having the raspy, horrid inflection he did in the games.

Please, whatever you do, do not waste part of your life watching this movie.

Go watch paint dry. Or listen to German schlÃ¤ger music. Try stacking coins to a record height.

ANYTHING ... just -anything- ... but watching this unholy travesty, this -waste- of film-equipment and this death-knell of acting careers. Or so we can hope ... if there is -any- justice in the world.

The ... single ... worst ... movie ... I ... have ... ever ... seen.

Ed Wood was Academy Awared material compared to this drivel.",1
Warcraft,"I can only say that the visual effects are okay (but not good given that large budget),and the rest simply sucks. I haven't played Warcraft before,but i heard it has a good story.So l went to see it with quite a expectation. But,ugh,it starts promising and soon went straight downward.The story is broken,and the acting is bad.I almost feel asleep during the half!This movie really has destroyed all my hope for the Warcraft series! I can see there's much potential in it,but i don't know what happened and these people simply ruined it!

Conclusion: Don't waste your time and money watching this movie.It's not worth it.",1
Warcraft,"1) I literally just created this profile 5 min ago to comment on this after seeing the word ""Great"" used in every second comment. 2) I had been waiting for this movie since 2007 when it was first announced and watched it upon its release. 3) Just keep in mind, this movie cost as much as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to produce... 4) I never comment on movies, so excuse my lack of 'professional movie review' terminology, however i feel that this is one film i am qualified to talk about.

Yes, i did have high expectations for this movie and i honestly thought that Blizzard had the opportunity to temporarily make WoW the largest MMORPG in the world once more if they play their cards right.

Whether you have heard of the story of Warcraft or not, you need to understand that Warcraft has arguably the richest story-line out of anything ever written and even some 'random' characters have very deep history.

So considering the above, the movie was utterly disappointing. This should never have been a movie in the first place, it should have been a series with 3 to 5 seasons of 10, 1 hour episodes in each season.

This movie was so rushed that when i tried to briefly explain to my wife (who is not familiar with the story) who the extremely important character which is integral to the story was (because the movie did not bother to do it at all), by the time i could finish my sentence the character was already dead...

When Garona Halforcen went from talking dirty to talking about her terrible past basically in a span of about 7 seconds had to be the cringest dialog in history.

Basically if you have had no expectation what so ever and have no idea about the story, objectively speaking, especially for a less mature viewer who does not take movies to seriously and who values fast, mindless action above all, the movie is about a 5.5 or 6/10. If you are more mature and not familiar with Warcraft and value a decently constructed plot with some character development then the movie is about a 3 or 4/10. If you are Chinese person who lives in China then, for got knows what reason, the movie is a 10/10 for you. If you like a well constructed story and character development and are familiar with the story (and understand the potential this movie had) then it is a 0/10.

The movie needed to collect USD 450 million to break even so i am happy it i did not reach that mark and OFFICIALLY flopped because it sucked!",1
Warcraft,"What a confusing mess of a movie and I play this game. Can't imagine someone who doesn't play this game even bothering with the movie.

The movie takes itself way too seriously; WOW the game has a wonderful sense of humor even with intense/scary situations. This movie has about as many laughs as a root canal.

The mixture of CGI and live actors looks really bad. Battle scenes aren't frightening in the least because it just looks FAKE.

Garona's fangs are laughable. Seriously you can't even be annoyed with the bad acting looking at those things! Save your money folks. Not even worth a Redbox rental.",1
Warcraft,"Today was the day. I trusted a 7,5 IMDb rating and got betrayed. I knew there was a game called ""world of warcraft"", I knew there is a huge fan base but I did not expect all of them to rate this movie with ten stars on IMDb.

About the movie: A very thin story line, a lot of artificial dramaturgy, parallels to Tarzan and Pocahontas, sometimes extremely bad CGI, compared with sometimes average and sometimes really, really bad acting.

After all I was really happy when the movie came to an end,I will definitely not watch any other parts. One more thing: Non-WOW Fanboys: Do not watch this piece of cringe-worthy piece of ""art"".

And as a humble German: Sorry for my bad English.",1
Warcraft,"I loved the previews, hyped and ready to see a great movie.... Sadly mistaken. I loved the beginning, sweet and action at the same time then....FLY away, rush to another bunch of characters, and kill every character that I was starting to like. A wasted romance, stupid deaths and why....

Spoiler

Why kill Durotan?! I loved him and learning about him. His part in the movie was sadly short and I wanted more. Also his son...what will happen?! The plot was not tied at the end, and I will admit if a sequel comes...I will ignore it.",1
Warcraft,"I saw the movie last night 00:01 after waiting 5 years or more for a Warcraft movie and then? The Lore is completely twisted. To a point where I as a big Warcraft fan (Warcraft 2 & 3, World of Warcraft and reader of a lot of Warcraft books) only can say: Duncan Jones never ever read one of the books or played Warcraft. I was really disappointed. This big and great Story of Warcraft is one part that made it what it is and not sticking to it, in such a absurd way, will make the movie for real fans very hard to like. And now I have to ride 10 lines of text, without spoilers for a movie I already have written more then he deserves.....",1
Warcraft,"This movie is so pathetically bad that one wonders how it ever got off the ground. The movie looked so pathetically hokey with the mix of real actors and CGI that I literally was wondering if this was some sort of parody movie of Lord of the Rings.

The actors seemed like they were just in it for a paycheck. I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.

The musical score was decent and there were a couple of good battle scenes, but honestly nothing special and not nearly enough to save this clunker of a movie.

They should have made this movie all CGI or used a lot more live actors and a whole lot less CGI. Trying to merge the 2 failed bigtime. Looks like the entire movie is just hype for the video game expansion.",1
Warcraft,"I am not a Warcraft gamer, so I do not know what the story behind is !!! I watched it as a movie and my rating is based on that !!!

The first thing is that this movie does not have any story to tell !!!

Being based on a game all I was expecting was just some action !!! Even that was not done well !!!

The second and most annoying part was the acting and directing !!!

The main character (Travis Fimmel) was extremely annoying (the CGI actors were way better than every human actor in the movie ), his acting was horrible, (was he really drank or was he trying to act as a drank ???), anyways all I saw from that guy was a very bad imitation of Johnny Deep's Jack Sparrow !!!

Overall the action part (you would expect pretty good ones for a movie based on a action game) was even not good enough !!!

Uwe Bool is known for making worst movies based on games, but even he could not make it worse than this one !!!",1
Warcraft,"I have done a lot of online gaming , warranted WOW wasn't something I ever got into so I thought I'd see this movie to see what the hype was about. I wasn't impressed and started falling asleep half way through. It was a plodding mess with so much CGI and boring battle scenes that I began to wonder why people in China are so into this movie ? I guess there are a lot of hard core WOW fanboys in China. Lucky for the backers of this movie as it is bombing here in the states. Summing up, Warcraft is a really poorly made boring video game movie that is on par with Street Fighter and Super Mario Bros. And no doubt it will get a sequel because of the idiots in China and other countries shelling out the cash for this bomb.",1
Warcraft,"This movie is very possible the worst movie I have ever seen, including any Adam Sandler movie produced.

First of all, the acting is atrocious. The magician has a mustache which wouldn't even make a 12 year old jealous and is as convincing as Kim Kardashian is a natural beauty. The main actor, who's best performance is being able to pull of looking like Leonardo DiCabrio in the Revenant, talks in an accent which makes my ears bleed. And any attempt of including romance is simply tragically funny.

More CGI is used than in all Michael Bay movies combined, with the added eye sore of not even attempting to conceal the excessive use of green screens. Talking about green, one can clearly see that the make up of the half-Orc is removed steadily by her own sweating. Most likely because the actress is increasingly anxious that her future acting career will be pivotally affected by her abysmal performance in this movie.

The plot is more confusing than quantum theory. I played the game for a while as well as a friend of mine. Both of us lost track of what was going on within 10 minutes. I guess when creatures start randomly hitting/stabbing/spell-casting each other without any apparent reason the only explanation can be found in the title: ""WARCRAFT!"".

All in all, pretty unbelievable that post production didn't decide to destroy all evidence of this movie ever being made in order to save their own careers as well as those of the rest of the cast.",1
Warcraft,"This movie is terrible. Horrible acting, characters with no substance who are impossible to care for, uninspired and uncertain directing, and a story with is so feeble and diluted. Diluted with admittedly OK CGI, yet that means absolutely nothing when you have such a terrible movie. Avoid at all costs! I desperately wanted my 2 hours returned to me after watching this terrible movie. Please recognize that it is only rated so high because fanboys have entirely zero ability to distinguish derivative narrative trash from a subject they love and good film. There was potential to make a good film out of World of Warcraft lore, but this movie missed the mark it's entirely possible to think you are living on a different world where there exist people who think that this movie could be considered good, much less a perfect movie. Once again, do not watch this movie if you value your time, your honor, your mother, or your understanding and awareness of quality.",1
Warcraft,"My partner purchased this dvd on sale, and I'm glad not much was spent on it, because it was worthless. Bad CGI, bad acting, bad plot, bad execution. Never again.",1
Warcraft,"Take a hint from Star Wars and scroll some text by! Let us non-gamers understand what is even going on! Apparently this is only meant to be watched by people who have played the game as the movie just races right off without explaining a thing. It ping pongs between cities and races with 10-20 second ""cut scenes"" that leave you puzzled what you just saw. I wanted to leave 15 minutes in but I lasted 30-40 minutes before I left the theater. Every minute was pure torture. Apparently this appeals to some group of people but I'm at a completely loss as to how or why.

If you watched this movie with someone who said they loved it you might want to reconsider your relationship with them. If your life long desire is to see this movie on the big screen I highly suggest you accomplish that quickly. I do not expect it to stick around very long.",1
Warcraft,"It's nice they made a whole movie that only exists so you can check your phone for the next two hours.

I am not deeply invested in Warcraft. The most of any Warcraft game I've played is maybe three missions of Warcraft 2 when I was a teenager. So a lot of what's being covered here... I understand some of the broad strokes, but by and large it's all new to me.

And there is so much wrong with Warcraft as a movie. Like a lot of video game movies, it takes its audience of granted. Though it's easy to understand what's going on at any given moment, the characters are what suffer the most. We are never given even the slightest reason to care about anyone or anything that's going on. We're just told ""this dude is the king"" and that's where characterization ends. Similarly, we see seconds of the orcs original home, so their plight has no meaning.

The green screen special effects in this movie are awful. It's not bad enough that every set and 75% of the characters are fake, it's that they are obviously fake. Orcs and dwarves are incredibly stylized and in a vacuum look like very good video game cutscenes, but you put them next to real human actors in actual costumes and the whole thing falls apart. From looking like ""a good video game"" to ""a bad video game,"" like you're looking at Sewer Shark or Corpse Killer on the Sega CD or something.

I know enough about other Blizzard games to know the complaints of their character design, too, about how all the men orcs get to be big and scary and ugly but the ladies look like bikini models with body paint, and there's a character in this -- Garona -- who is literally just a normal live action actor painted green so you know she's an orc. I guess, technically, she's supposed to be half-orc, but still. I couldn't get it out of my head that she only looks that way because ladies have to be pretty.

Though, speaking of characters looking bad, the other problem is that even when we get 100% real sets and there are only human actors on screen, everything looks like a theme park. Every interior is spotless, none of the armor or clothing looks like it's ever been worn, everything's totally pristine and completely fake. Nobody lived in this world until 10 seconds before the cameras started rolling.

And don't even get me started on the orc voices. Every orc speaks through a voice filter, but it sounds like when I mess up my settings in Audacity. Even the brief moment we hear Clancy Brown, a dude who can growl and bellow just fine, he also gets slathered in this digital, robotic warble. All the orcs not only look computer generated, but sound like it, too. It's sloppy.

Just a completely worthless waste of money on every single possible front.",2
Warcraft,"After rewaching this film I now see how bad it is. The story and tempo is horrible and as a Warcraft fan downright infuriating. It has few good things to mention but that is weighed down by everything else.

I write this review as a Warcraft fan that knows a lot about the world and it's charecters. This will of course affect the way I see the world and charecters done in it. You might not notice this as an outsider to the world so keep that in mind.

We follow two factions orcs and humans, in a war over the world Azaroth. Not all the orcs are against Humans thought and conflicts finds itself inside both the orcs and humans own ranks.

There is way too many chatecters to keep track of here. We barely get to know anyone and therefore connects with none of them. We barely get to know them other than surfaced leveled trades whitch makes you not care for anyone's safety ot story outcome.

The effects are really bad in this movie whitch is a surprise from a project involving Blizzard. There a few well done shots and charecters like the orc leaders but everything else looks like a computer game from the PlayStation 3 era.

The stories told are just not interesting. The orc's plot is the most interesting while the humans plot is a lot of talking about doing something without actually doing anything. The plots tempo is one million miles an hour. It tries to cram as much content into it's runtime as possible whitch means we as the viewers get to apeiciate nothing about the world. It moves to fast to take anything in.

The real Warcraft world is complecated and lorefilled. It is hard to explain and without given time hard to apeiciate. Not everything is just good and evil everything is in a state of grey where you understand actions from chatecters. This movie uses fel as a copout to just say there is now good and evil and we won't explain why.

Furthermore the plot name-drops so many locations, chatecters, spells and lore that you as a newcomer will understand abolutly nothing of what's going on. It wants you to understand the world way too fast and way too many things that you end up understanding nothing. As a Warcraft fan I know some of this and finds it frustrating. It's not explained well for fans nor newcomers.

I can not recommended this movie. It's poorly made and way too rushed. Forgettable characters, boring world and awful tempo. This adoptation hurts personally.",2
Warcraft,"An overuse of special effects cannot carry this films woeful plot and script. Big money can't replace talent in the script writing and development of the story. Despite the craftsmanship if the CG specialists, many scenes are ruined by the poor art direction, with a cacophony of noisy and jarring colours of blue and green. Even die hard fans will be sorely disappointed at what is no less an abomination of the franchise. So, as the plot and script are beyond redemption, I'll describe the visual elements. The style and scenery is overtly influenced by the Chinese production companies involved. Although many technical talents have been employed, the art direction is immature and game-like. CG characters appear to be designed by game developers not cinematic specialists. The scenery lacks depth in representing its origin from Blizzard. Even Blizzards internal art teams produced higher quality unique cut scenes in the game, than any scene in this 90 minute travesty. I had wanted to see this movie succeed and do well, but the immature and narrow artistic view of the Chinese production companies involved has failed to carry the magic from our computers to the big screen.",2
Warcraft,"This film is definitely for the fans.

I saw it together with a ""WOW player"" and he loved it. Much due too several ""Easter eggs"" and his background knowledge about places, weapons and magic.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the fantasy genre, but this film did not convince me. The biggest issue for me was the basic story telling buildup, to many locations changes, to much magic and poor character performances. The best actors where the orcs.

The main character is ""Ragnar Lothbrok"" from the ""Vikings"" series. He is playing the same character in this movie. just like Steven Seagal (who play the same role in all his films)

The guess the current rating 8,2/10 is gonna drop.

B",2
Warcraft,"Warcraft may possibly be the dumbest big budget Hollywood film since Battlefield Earth, without any of its precious unintentional comedy. That's not to say it's the worst one since Battlefield Earth, there are many more worthy of that title, but from a sheer case of internal and emotional logic, Warcraft is the most mindbogglingly idiotic trainwreck I've seen since. It's a visually ugly, humorless, braindead catastrophe that could be outwritten by a 9 year old with one of the worst endings I've ever seen. Additionally, it gets worse the more I actually think about it. The film has been in development Hell since the mid-2000s with Uwe Boll offering to direct and, honestly, I may have turned out preferring his film. At least I could laugh at how bad that one might have been. In its current state, Warcraft is just tedious.

The first thing to know about Warcraft is that nearly the entire film is exposition and world building. It feels less like an actual movie and more like an introductory video game cutscene. Warcraft doesn't care about developing its characters or making them relatable and interesting and complex. It's far more interested in shoving in as many Easter eggs to in game locations and lore as they can. Those two things should exist to strengthen the story and the characters, not the other way around. Even as a casual fan of the games, I could care less about how faithful it is the source material when there is nothing close to a coherent narrative.

Remember in my Spider-Man 3 review where I said the characters behaved the way they did to service the plot and not out of any actual emotional logic or reasoning? Imagine that x100 and you have Warcraft. Garona is the adult daughter of a human and an Orc despite Orcs only just beginning to interact with humans. Anduin and Garona fall in love immediately despite sharing nothing in common and having only about 2 scenes of highly limited interaction with each other. There's a scene where the evil Orc warlock Gul'dan cheats in an honor duel to which the Orcs are somehow surprised at his lack of honor. Why they would be surprised by the dishonorable actions of a monster who literally devours the life of entire worlds, I have no idea. The film then builds up this moment as if it's going to be a major turning point in the story, only for Gul'dan to kill the first Orcs to dissent to his rule and for the story to continue and Orcs remain loyal as if nothing happened. The King's brilliant solution to bring peace between Orcs and humans is to have Garona, the only Orc who humans seem to unanimously trust, kill him to prove herself to the Horde...And then the Orcs and humans go to war anyway. The entire film really is headache inducingly preposterous, I could hardly believe what I was witnessing. I do strongly remember slowly sinking into my theater seat in embarrassment for calling myself a fan of this franchise as I watched this unparalleled idiotfest unfold.

So everything I just listed sounds pretty stupid and incoherent, does it not? You may be thinking that it may at least be bad in an entertaining way. Unfortunately, unlike the aforementioned Battlefield Earth, the actors aren't having nearly enough fun or energy to make the film enjoyable even on an ironic level. Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell and Clancy Brown are at least serviceable in their voice-heavy, animalistic portrayals of Orcish characters, but everyone else is clearly phoning it in. Travis Fimmell, Ben Foster and even the exceptionally talented Dominic Cooper are all sleep walking through this travesty, none of them are giving their best effort at all. This was very much a ""Read the lines, take the paycheck"" role for these actors. If the film was this much of a slog to force myself through as an audience member, I can only imagine the agonizing nightmare it was to film. Thank Christ that God awful sequel bait ending never went anywhere.

Another thing worth noting is just how ugly the film is. As much as I hated The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, it at least somewhat had its own identity. If I was flipping through channels and managed to catch a Lord of the Rings movie on TV, I would know it was a Lord of the Rings movie. If I saw this on TV, I'd probably think it was a Malefecent spinoff. That or one of those unbearable Hobbit films. There is no style to this film, no atmosphere. It looks like every crappy, half-assed fantasy film released in the past 12 years. If the film was so low on substance, the least it could have is style, but unfortunately, Warcraft has neither.

Apparently, this film is beginning to get something of a fanbase, but I can't for the life of me figure out why. Even as a fan of the games, this fan service trash hardly seems respectful. It's like the filmmakers couldn't think of a compelling story or characters so they just threw Easter eggs hoping they would stick. It's a boring, poorly acted, weakly characterized and ugly nightmare that I never want to watch again. There are so many better fantasy epics than this. There are so many better video game movies than this. I don't have to settle for this bottom-of-the-barrel dumpster fire of used diapers.",2
Warcraft,"I'm a little puzzled about some of the other reviews and I'm wondering if I saw the same movie.

I think it was a mediocre film at best. The acting was bad and contrived with actors expressing very little in the way of emotions and displaying a forced solemnity that made me cringe a couple times. The story is lackluster and bland with serious pacing issues and tropes seen dozen of times before. While I was watching I couldn't shake that feeling the film tried very hard to achieve an epic grandeur like a Lord of the ring but failed at that because its source material is just not very deep. It felt amateurish, frantic, trying to cram too much things in one place. Only watch it if you are a Die-Hard fan of the Warcraft games I guess.",2
Warcraft,"...but they very well basically might be. OK, I'm saying that. They're paid reviews. The positive reviews are fake. This movie is not good. Use your judgment. Don't be a fool. There are people who get paid to write fake reviews. Of course everyone knew Warcraft was going to be a trash movie, just like the game has been going totally downhill since 2011 or so. Of course a huge company is going to pay PR companies to write positive reviews and artificially buff the score of the film. Why wouldn't they do that? So, I'm not necessarily upset about that. They made a movie, they want to make money off of it. But the movie shouldn't have been made to begin with. This film just randomly throws in a bunch of superficial aspects of the game (e.g., Oooh, they're flying on Griffins!) with some atrocious writing and acting. The film exemplifies just how bad the game has gotten and how removed it is from the actual culture of WoW and all the things that made the game appealing and good. The movie is downright awful. The scene where the orc chick calls out the insufferably nerdy mage for wanting to go to bed with her, and then refusing, is so completely telling of the targeted demographic of this film. The demographic is the nerdy mage. It's too bad this film was made. I'll admit the game was really great in it's heyday and started to decline with Lich King and overcomplicating and over-noobifying everything. Any true fan of the game will agree with me. Don't watch this film.",2
Warcraft,"I cannot express enough how bad this movie is. It is a horrible combombulation of bad CGI and bad acting. The script could have been written by a six year old. Too much fluff and not enough substance. In other words, it is kind of like a comic book movie but without the cool characters behind it.

Actually now that I've watched it completely, it's a disgusting attempt at at a cross between Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and some kind of comic book movie. Do not waste your time or money on this drivel. I do not think I can even call it a ""movie"". It is a video game, trying to be a movie and it fails miserably. Bad. Just bad.",2
Warcraft,"If you're a fanboy.. it will be like watching someone play Warcraft on a big TV.. you'll love it.

If you're not a fanboy.. avoid this horrible film at all costs.

The actors cannot act with everything looking staged and mechanical (I AM talking about the acting not the CGI)

The CGI is nearly as good as Avatar .. now, this isn't a compliment .. Avatar is 7 years old. The CGI is as 'clean' as avatar (or a cartoon..) doesn't look anyway 'weathered' to make things blend

The scenes with actors with 'real' plant-life looks like it was shot in a local garden centre with some bamboo stalks stuck into the ground as the mediocre actors read out a mediocre script putting on mediocre expressions on their faces as they turn mechanically around making it painfully obvious they're trying to avoid the camera or don't realise when people talk to each other they're not trying to bore holes into the other persons skull without blinking or looking away at and stage of their 'deep' conversation.

I'd have thought acting 101 would have been a prerequisite for a the cast, but apparently not.

I must admit, some of the acting did improve in the last 20 minutes .. it's amazing what 1.5hrs of (usable) work experience does.",2
Warcraft,"Duncan Jones is a fabulous film maker. His first two movies, Moon and Source Code were both chock full of flair, style, and panache.......much like his father.

This however, is a total product of the studio, but if you look close enough, just past the dead eyes of the Orcs, you can just make out some of Jones' presence surrounding the film.

After realising that their home is becoming uninhabitable, a race of orcs travel to the land of Azeroth.

There, they encounter the realm's human inhabitants, who fight back against the invaders. In time, an orc warrior forges an alliance with a group of humans in order to overthrow his race's corrupt leader and bring peace to the land........

Oh the film looks impressive, the special effects are second to none, but my gosh, the rest of the film is confusing mess of lore and characters that just seem to come out of the book of game to movie cliché.

To sum it up, it's like a few extras from The Last Temptation Of Christ have teamed up with the Hulks hippy relatives, and need to overthrow something from Guardians of the Galaxy, but a lot less fun.

So it's a case of big money spent on what seems like never ending battles, Cooper saying to Paula Patton, 'kill me and all will be well', Ben Foster doing his obligatory bad guy routine (the best thing about this sorry mess), and of course, the really awkward humour that just about peppers the odd scene every now and again.

I don't think that it matters that I've never played WoW, but I can well imagine that two hours on that would be more forfillng than having to sit through this dreck again.

Honestly, if it was camp, and didn't take itself as serious as it did, it could have been something.

Another expensive bore-fest.

Don't hold your breath for the sequel....",2
Warcraft,"This review is going to be short, informative and honest. Let's get started!

Screenplay is bad. Universe is not formed. Rushed and forced story.

Human cast is horrible. Paula Patton deserved a Golden Raspberry Award. I wonder how she managed to not to crack while saying all those lines. Travis Fimmel is a good looking man but he clearly overacts. He behaves like a soccer player on a field, not like a mighty warrior. Casting Dominic Cooper as a King was a complete failure. No stars for this set of ""stars"" (kek).

CGI could stand out. But it did not. It's all become unrealistic the moment the human characters are joining the set. Makeup is bad, requisite is cheap. You either do balance animated characters and humans or you remove someone to get a realistic picture.

Let's talk about music, shall we? Oh, wait... There is no music! I mean, Blizzard, what happened? Even Warcraft TFT had a good music. Diablo 2 had different and memorable score. Here you got nothing but clacking sounds.

I see why this film had a warm reception in my trashy country (Russia) and other third-world countries. People with lack of intellect will indubitably love this.

Conclusion: it has no cinematic value. Not worth watching.",2
Warcraft,"Don't take my review as a reason not to go see it honestly. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because while the movie itself is lacking the visuals are indeed incredible in my opinion.

I gave it such a low rating because it's like playing Warlords of Draenor all over again, the hype far surpassed my expectations of what I would be receiving. In any case my biggest concerns for this movie were that it was extremely clunky, it's like the story couldn't follow a line and you jumped all over the place giving it a very...empty feeling. It's not to be said either that Blizzard can't tell a fascinating story. For any of you Blizzard fans who haven't check out the short series they've done for Overwatch characters, a stunning example of their capabilities in just a few 5-10min clips.

I feel like most people are simply rating this high because they were impressed by the graphics and ignored all the other lacking features, because the battle scenes I have to admit were nice to watch. However I believe the biggest reason this is rated so high is because they've never actually played a game/know the lore.

TL:DR If you've played the games at all, I feel you'll most likely be disappointed more than someone who's never played anything who would most give this 8-10stars. I did cry at the end though, not because of the movie but for the fact I had to pay 60$ for me and my girl to go see it in I-max with snacks.",2
Warcraft,"There is a reason why real gamers pick on Warcraft gamers as being immature, and the least respectable of gamers. Blizzard doesn't care so much about quality as they do for their bottom line, so integrity in gaming goes out the window, especially obviously in movie making as well, and flashy over the top seeming special effects trickery get lost with the extremely weak and unmotivated story line. The majority of most of the character motivation are lost with unexplained illogical pettiness. All of the civilian reviews are of Warcraft gamers base. If Blizzard didn't have that they would never have made a movie knowing they would not have gotten their money back.

There are some that even dare to compare this to 'Lord Of The Rings'. Are you kidding me? They are different worlds, and don't even belong in the same universe. If Bizarro would have made a fantasy movie based off of 'Lord Of The Rings', 'Warcraft' would have been it. Flashy special effects can fool the least intellectually challenged among us, and the weak story line, and conversations can and did smoothly slip by like a snake to the uninitiated. Even the special effects really weren't that well done. If I can tell it's CGI then it's not very good. The whole point is to fool you that its real isn't it? It's an 'Avatar' wanna be. It's the same people that think '2012', 'Battleship', 'Hardcore Henry' where phenomenal movies. If you are one of those people I'm sure you will be tickled pink by the lost attempts at humor, and puns. The only time I knew there was a joke intended was because of the very awkward long pause. Then I was left thinking, what was the joke?

I have played Warcraft for years, and had thee most successful guild of over 300 active players on my server, and quit, because of the maturity factor with the game and the players. Too much trolling.

So if you are of the more cerebral variety you won't get much from this movie including your money back. There is a reason why we need to ignore the wanna be civilian critics since they tend to always be wrong, and rate opposite of official critics. Why is that? Take a look at Rotten Tomatoes. 27%. I didn't think anything could be worse than 'Superman vs. Batman'. I was wrong. You will get the same shameless overzealous immature wanna be critics of that movie as well saying it's the best movie ever! I think there should be consequences for these critics that they pay for your ticket if you didn't like the movie, and I don't mean little bit, but hated it. Maybe then they would be a bit more conservative with their over zealous critique.

Comparing this to 'Lord Of The Rings' is beyond laughable. No Oscar nominations for this movie, not even for special effects. LOL",2
Warcraft,"It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It isn't even the worst movie I've seen lately. But it is one of the most boring movies I managed to sit the entire way through in recent memory. The magic effects are done well. I had no problem with the acting. But I could not get invested in the story. They didn't develop the world or the characters sufficiently for someone who has never played the games to care about. Every character is a cardboard cutout. The action scenes are unthrilling and leave *a lot* to be desired. Obviously everyone has their own tastes, but I can't even figure out what it was the people who liked this movie (who did not play the games) saw in it. It has no other redeeming qualities.",2
Warcraft,"It seems to me that most of the ""praise"" this movie is getting, comes from fans of the online game ""World of Warcraft"" (or possibly the old Warcraft RTS games, if they are as old as I am). Well, this is one gamer that is going to give the honest truth about how I felt about this awful film.

The CGI (which is the only decent thing about it), seemed to be more impressive than the actual story. For those of you who are unfamiliar with any of the Warcraft games, basically the main plot goes like this: A bunch of stupid ugly shrek-like monsters called Orcs, decided to leave their trashy planet (that they ruined), to enter through a portal and ruin a new one. The humans of this new world end up fighting the Orc's, some of the Orc's fight each other. The End. The acting was absolutely terrible, especially from Paula Patton. Every line she recites is completely void of any believable emotion. Ben Schnetzer was not much better.

The only joy I got from this film, were the brief moments when they showed some of the areas I remembered from the MMO. ""Oh cool there's Stormwind, there's Goldshire, there's Ironforge"" etc, but that's because I've played the game! If you are not a fan of ""World of Warcraft,"" don't watch this movie, because there is nothing worthwhile for you. It's just another over-hyped poor excuse for a modern adventure movie, filled with a ton of CGI animation which seems to be more important than having any originality or substance.",2
Warcraft,"This film excels in money making cause it is suitable as a franchise to satisfy fans. Great green-screen scenery, imaginative static frames and camera work (1 star). Cast was also fine: none expected any kind of acting in game-based movies. Ben Foster and Travis Fimmel overacted but it worked out fine after all. I liked CGI and the make-up job at some point (not elven tho, they were horribly designed). For instance, discolorations on faces in various scenes were on point (2 stars). All of this do make a good wrapper to sell stuff.

Positive signs had been destroyed by some ""A-movie criteria"" which are almost non-existent here. There are tons of questions about villains motivation. Of course you can guess about ""moving factors"" of global events. But no character motivation actually is explained, scene just happened and you are obviously left to wait for another part to figure all the reasons. That's not how you make a good movie, even franchised one. See ""Lord of the Rings"" on how this problem can be solved in fantasy genre.

Director also abandoned character development for some reason and chose to focus on visuals. And sometimes you feel an overdose on visuals: long shots in action scenes are failed to impress. Particular shots and close-ups of main orks like Durotan are sexy, beautifully made. But all those theatrical props are no use since we have no character development. Cuz nothing can distract a viewer from cheap-looking requisite but a true Warcraft-fan excitement (look at their Ornate Plate and weapon: ""Life is plastic, It's fantastic!""). This excitement also supports the weak screenplay. Not even worth mentioning.

It feels like the film has no director! Things are happening, ugly elves are talking, useless dwarfs remain useless, characters are dying, but you could not care less about them cause they were not developed and their motivation is primitive yet confusing sometimes.

So here you have it: being a fan you don't need all those pesky ""good movie attributes"". Fans got what they needed. But does it have a creative value? Surely not. It has a commercial value only. It is entertaining here and there but not worth your money unless you are strongly addicted to ""Warcraft"" universe. Too much money and effort and time were invested in ""Warcraft"" to make another meaningless spectacle. And none cares if it's ""the best of the worst"" game-based film, it is still bad and looks poorly written. Maybe later they'll make something deeper out of it, but not now. Sorry. Next.",2
Warcraft,"First time I review, I had to do it with this one. I almost expend 25 bucks watching this thing in cinema, I'm happy I didn't. It's a visual opera, that is right, and the story is very original, that is right too. But the jumps in the story, and the torrent of information (too much) that the characters tell you in form of dialogues (that for some reason we should understand), it's what really kills this film. The Orc's story line it's awesome, but the human's story line is lame. They had 2 hours to develop and make the public understand what was going on, but they chose to rush in the critical parts that make the story understandable. They don't explain anything, they just keep moving the story forward and you are supposed to understand everything... The only story line that I got 100% is the orcs, and it's just awesome. The rest... I didn't get a thing. Terrible writing. I can't wait to see the Blue Ray version, though. But this film is not an 8 stars, no F**ING way.

It's a 6 but I thing I have to balance the current rating so I'll go for a 2, just to compensate.",2
Warcraft,"I have two thing to say right off. Me and my 11 year old only made it through about 15 minutes of this before we both agreed to leave. And 2) I was one of the biggest LOTR fans ever out there (books and movies), and the little I saw of this was total dreck. So PLEASE don't say gee man if you liked (the exquisitely grounded) LOTR well you're SURE to like this. NOT!! The best stories dealing with complex worlds start you out with a relatable character and go real slow, they add one piece at a time. This one throws you into an unpleasant setting and expects you to know everything right off the bat. It has the feel of manufactured substance when in fact this movie looked to me to be without much substance at all. Some of the scenes are impressive in Imax (the only way this was offered on premier, probably another tell on its quality), but that isn't nearly enough for me. I need a character I can relate to and a story I can understand and enjoy. There was a lot about this that reminded me of the dreadful Strange Magic, I think on that one we lasted about 5 minutes more than on this. I'm not saying there isn't an audience for this movie, I'm just saying I loved LOTR and liked Star Wars and I had no interest in watching another single minute of whatever this was supposed to be. Also note in the short time there there were scenes which troubled my 11 year old, and the Imax was way too loud for him. So my vote is save your hard-earned money for something else. I also must say that the chorus of positive IMDb reviews for this movie are just not believable.",2
Warcraft,"The fact that this film currently has a 7.5/10 on IMDb genuinely astonishes me. What we have here is what you get when a film is made by a group with a good budget and absolutely no idea how to make movie.

The scenes are short and disjointed, so much so that comprehending the story line is like being on a speeding train, trying to observe the passing landscape through a hole the size of your fist. Blizzard's story telling has always been shoddy, and this film is no exception.

The special effects are inconsistent. Yeah, the orcs look pretty cool, but so many other effects look as cheap as the guy next door's LARP costume (the night elves standout in my memory as horrendous.)

I'm a long time Warcraft fan (WC2 → WC3 → WoW,) and the references to the games were so thin that it hurt. This is a film with absolutely no subtly. Yeah, that's the murloc sound. Hilarious.

Over the course of two hours, there were very few redeeming qualities. For the most part, it was an absolute affront to the senses and sensibilities. Anyone who appreciates a film for its writing and cinematographic qualities should avoid this film like the plague, or risk being enraged and offended at the butchery Warcraft does to these arts.

If I wasn't with friends I would have walked out of the theater.",2
Warcraft,"Warcraft is yet another failed attempt at adapting a video game into a movie. Aside from some interesting animation, this film doesn't have much to offer. The story is predictable, the action is bland and the humor falls flat. Do yourself a favor and find a copy of the old Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness DOS game instead - it's much more fun than watching this movie. Zug zug!",3
Warcraft,"Before this my only knowledge of anything warcraft came from hearing a few friends talk about it years ago and the south park episode so I had no pre-conceived notions and no bias about how things ""should"" be. Even so the shortcomings of this movie are plain to see

This was never intended to be a movie, it has no narrative and despite a bloated runtime no depth and zero character development, it also doesn't even pretend to have an ending because the studio higher ups had hoped that simpyl slapping the ""warcraft"" name on something would allow them to create a movie devoid of story to serve as a platform for zero effort sequels, prequels and spin off. OK cgi, action scenes that aren't too bad considering they are no blood/family friend fights, a good cast and literal decades of lore and stories to draw from, this definetly had potential but it was squandered by studios rabid desire to churn out marvel esque spin offs and crossover slop rather than focusing on creating a movie that can stand on it's own merit.

There are 2 important characters who accomplish nothing and then are brushed aside and before the scene even gets to sink in we are pushed into the next family friendly, long distance shot of fighting.

There are characters from literal different worlds who have no conversations, no sizing each other up, no growing to trust each other, in the span of 30 seconds they go from fighting to the death to ""ok stranger from a different place, a different species, I blindly have so much trust in you that I will put my kids lives in your hand, here I will even hand you a weapon"".

Henry stickman is less of a one dimensional character than all those in this movie and there is not a single scene in this movie that has any significance, any weight or any impact.",3
Warcraft,"Before I cause offence with my opinion - please note I have never played nor read any WoW material...

I know nothing of the video game, but heard it's a huge success with a world wide fan base. As an avid film critic, I was very surprised at how thin the storyline was & the poor choice in casting and dry acting. Visual effects were superb & the sets (real ones) werent too bad.

I'm pretty sure there's a lot of die-hard WoW fans, who's agree with me when I say...

""This film disappointed me""",3
Warcraft,"This film has world-unknown actors and world-unknown they will remain. The whole is only computer animation. Such was also ''Avatar'', but there was any idea there. There is no such a thing here. The effects only make sense when it makes any sense at all, but this movie is a full nonsense. His nothingness is more noticeable if we compare it to the masterpieces of the fantasy ''The lord of the rings'' and ''Game of thrones''. Rate - 3 and only because I succeeded to watch it to the end.",3
Warcraft,"Having never played a minute of Warcraft, I didn't have much hope that this movie would entertain me, and somehow it managed to live down to those low expectations. For starters, the CGI is not great. Everything other than the humans looks like a video game, so I'm not sure what this movie was adding for the fans. As with any movie based on a video game, I have to imagine it would be more fun to actively play these adventures than just watching them in bad CGI. It's not the worst animation I've ever seen, but it needed more practical elements for me to believe the humans were interacting with something real. Then there's the overload of ridiculous names for all these characters. It feels like so much of this movie is made up of people just talking about other people, and I could not track who was who because all their names sounded like gobbledygook.

The plot is highly predictable, and that made it overly boring for me. There are a few reveals that people are infected with this evil magic, and it's the most obvious people imaginable. I also struggled a bit with the use of green to indicate someone was connected to the dark magic, because it wasn't used consistently. Then there's the horrible cast. Even actors that I typically enjoy were disappointing in Warcraft, and some of the lead roles are granted to no-name people that will probably remain no-names if this is the best they can do. I didn't manage to even be slightly interested in the story of Warcraft, partially because all the characters were dull or despicable. It's one of those movies where I started to zone out during the action sequences. I've certainly seen worse fantasy adventure films, but Warcraft is still low on the list.",3
Warcraft,"What I really liked about the film was...uhm, erm...(Yawn) what was I saying? Was it the visual effects? A resounding no, as it was so overdone, I might have well been watching the game. The acting? Nope, unconvincing. The story? Ya-a-a-awn. The dialogue? Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha!! I'm not really sure what to make of this film. It was entertaining, I suppose, on a certain level, but in general I just didn't like it. The 'love story' was so utterly pathetic and annoying. And what's with the Biblical Moses 'child-in-basket' moment??? THAT was laughable. I mean seriously?!

The film ends with an obvious hope for a sequel (also alternatively being called Warcraft: The Beginning), but I'm not sure I'd like to see it.",3
Warcraft,"This movie feels like it was focus grouped to death. From the trailer and onwards it's just a weird mesh of things outsiders thinks is demographicly appealing, and the things fans of this franchise probably genuinly was excited for. You had a franchise with millions of fans, and it seemed like that was not good enough and they wanted to appeal to everyone. If you ever had a blizzard product in hand you know just how abhorrent the trailer was. Really, you gonna slap dubstep on a blizzard movie? This movie was never going to be well recieved by critics, so why not give the fans the experience they hoped for? I dont see who would enjoy this film.",3
Warcraft,"I gave this film one star the film is mediocre at best. The effects are top notch, but that's about all that's top notch in this film filled with clichés and fantasy tropes. The action sequences are meh, the acting is bland and the music is generic. The plot for this film is supposed to be based in Warcraft, but they've changed much of the story to fit what they'd prefer to do(or make things look cooler). That's usually mistake #1 in these processes, but I'll go ahead and blame those thought Warcraft should be made into a film in the first place. The lore itself was always extremely hack and essentially stolen from other sources(with a few twists so they didn't get sued). Then you add in the people that they cast so they could spend on CGI and it was a recipe for disaster from the start. What Blizzard should have done is made straight to Netflix CGI movies using high quality VO talent. Instead they made a mediocre fantasy movie that never really works. Only see this movie if you absolutely have to have a fantasy fix that week and haven't seen any good fantasy movies... ever.",3
Warcraft,"As usual one needs to only look into the bad reviews written by sharp people. Because those positive-yay-reviews seem to be written by small retarded children, on crack.

I must tell you how i got to this conclusion. Background

I was watching this movie with my daughter, age 10. She has highly evolved EQ. And together we watched this movie and another day also an old goodie from the 90 ties - Dances with wolves. After we watched both and had some days contemplation she said clearly - Dances with wolves was sooooo much better than Warcraft movie. And she is a Warcraft III TFT fangirl. I was amazed over the fact that she had gotten my perception without me influencing her. This movie was sooo much worse than an epic movie.

Now to the point Blizzards most successful game in the Warcraft series is Warcraft III TFT. Its epic, and it contains epic cinematics. And actually much better acting by the CGI actors, then the evolved CGI-actors of this movie. The cinematic clips are available on YouTube.

Moon 2009 is up amongst my favorite movies (Duncan Jones) so what could go wrong with Warcraft 3? Well about everything.

The first scenes of the orcs are humans. wtf? The orcs laugh and have humor and one would think that they actually are humans. Have the producers even touched the games? Orcs are savages and brutes, the are not humans, they don't joke around. So even the first orc scene was a horrid face palm. I understand to some degree that the producers wanted to make the orcs likable, but with this behavior its not orcs anymore. Its like putting a wolf in costume making him drive a Volvo and putting this into a nature documentary. Thus with this movie a completely new human orc like-race subspecies has been created. Halleluja.

The rest of this movie is as bad as the beginning. Predictability is something i despise. After first 15 minutes the whole plot for this first part of Warcraft was 100 % accurately predicted. The acting was horrid, no chemistry between the actors, everything rushed, no depth, on Prozac, Anduin Lothar lost his only child - a whiskey later and some encouraging words and off we go to war again with a smile. Cheap like a Bangkok prostitute. Probably cheaper nowadays.

Also Dominic Cooper as king, really. Really are you serious? Total horrid experience. ""Yeah just take my life"", ""im glad to sacrifice myself although i have kids and wife at home"" - must be the Prozac.

Also it really felt like a ""beginning"", like you bought the ticket and got to see 10 minutes of the the really shitty movie.

The positives Well the CGI at times was satisfactory, some elements like the mage-spells were powerfully and elegantly performed for instance when Medivh protected the warrior band.

In summary i expected way better.",3
Warcraft,"A horde of Orcs, migrating from their own land due to it being threatened, invade the world of Azeroth. There they encounter humans, resulting in a titanic struggle.

Conventional, dull action-fantasy drama. A basic linear plot, filled with sword-and-sorcery action scenes and expensive graphics. Characters have no depth, limiting the audience engagement, and the movie feels much like any other other fantasy movie, that is, much style, little substance.

Decent cast - Travis Fimmel (of Vikings fame), Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper - but wasted on this empty movie. Considering the wooden acting required for this, I don't think this is going to help their CVs...

Saddest thing about this movie is that it is directed by Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son). After a great debut with Moon and a decent follow-up with Source Code, he now resorts to directing this crap. The money must have been really good because he certainly wasn't doing it for the awards or critical acclaim...",3
Warcraft,"The good: The CG is very well done for the most part. A fair bit of action and interesting special effects. Seeing a world from a much-loved video game franchise brought to life on the big screen will fill WoW fans with contentment for a short while.

The bad: Although the plot has more than a few twists, they aren't that surprising. Worse, they don't have much impact because, among the large cast of characters, only a couple can be connected to on an emotional level. In my case, Durotan, the main Orc protagonist, was the only character I felt any attachment to, and it wasn't all that much. Garona, the human-orc hybrid, played by Paula Patton, was next in line. She has some complexity and an interesting look, but I mostly ""meh"". The rest of the characters could bathe in glory or their own blood for all I cared.

My two sons agreed that the movie was forgettable with my eleven year-old stating that the best thing about the movie was the popcorn.

Which brings me to my point: As I write, Warcraft currently has an IMDb rating of 7.4. The reviews written in May, most of which were made before the official release date of May 24th (in France), are highly positive (9-10). The reviews begin to shift to highly negative (3-4) in late May and into June as the movie was released in more countries (ie. North America on June 10th). Currently, the main competing movie and TV review sites rate Warcraft much more negatively than IMDb. Clearly, the IMDb rating and review system is being successfully gamed. I will be taking that into account from here on out when looking at IMDb reviews and will be consulting ratings from competing review sites before making any decisions.

How the mighty have fallen.",3
Warcraft,"LOTR, Alien, Spiderman, Terminator, Jurassic, Star Wars... Will this century be the death of everything that makes us human? Will technology kill the last brain cells that Apple still hasn't?

Something is wrong... When Tales of the Past 3, a machinima circa WotLK, made by one person... Can outperform a marvel of CGI. A hand-made game engine movie... that has more soul than a 160$ mil motion picture. How could Blizzard do it? When I found out that Legendary Pictures is producing it - I was overjoyed. They are to movies like Blizzard... ""is"" to games - every movie is magnificent, even if it's written by Snyder. But I thought that... with minds like ""the"" Metzen, with books that were written by bestselling authors, the series that can rival any other major and older franchise... I thought they would do Warcraft justice.

Warcraft is their baby. How could they do it? Who in the bloody blue **** is Duncan Jones? How can he say something like ""was the stale fantasy trope of, humans are the good guys, monsters are the bad guys""? Now I respect Moon and treat it better than Martian, but Moon was... like a puppy to the elephant, compared to Warcraft. It was a good ""indie"" movie, but with just two movies on record, how can Blizzard hire someone like him? Is he Shyamalan? Who may be fanatical, but who damn knows how to write a mystery? Is he Jackson? Who at least has directed the best fantasy trilogy in the history of cinema? Is he ""the"" Nolan?

I know it's too cliché to say ""Nolan should've directed it"". Hell, that's all DC has been saying since DKR. But if anyone is good at directing EPIC grade masterpieces - that's either Nolan or Jackson. Why give the rights to the movie to a person, who first of all did not understand the core concept of Warcraft. Who tried to make it all mopey and kind, when it's... ****ing WARcraft. Not LOTRaft.

So without further ""ado"", let me say that I, being a heartfelt fan, who promised to curse the movie for eternity if they **** up ""The Last Guardian""(which... oh boy, they did) - still acknowledge that the movie has its heart in the right place. Like Medivh explained the hourglass - the order of how the pieces fall does not matter - they all are in the bottom of the glass. So does the movie resolve mostly according to Warcraft lore. However, only ""mostly"". And I feel like the remaining part will yet cause uncalled for protraction that will screw up even more memories. Like - Doomhammer will kill Lothar, but it would not be a champion, who would later go in a long journey of repentance and searching for new purpose. It would be a silly ""BvS Martha"" level of misunderstanding, because of how Llane assassination went. Hell, how many tears were shed upon the lines ""The orc chieftains agree with you"". Hell, even Yogg-Saron encounter was better than this movie's ""Kill me, save yourself"", that completely removes all the guilt, because it was a voluntary death, an order...

Bah, okay. It should be obvious by now that the story has been twisted beyond any value. It should be painful to realize that the simple people will imagine that this is Warcraft. It's like thinking that Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy(you get my point). If only the story perversion was enough - that would be fine. However, the acting, the performance is deplorable. Where is the brooding Medivh? Who is this clown that is trying to make a serious face? Where is the grand Lothar? Why is there Ragnar Lothbrok? A troubled comedian viking, whose place is on small screen? Where is the King Llane? The strategist, the hero of his people? Who is this... this... popeyed creep? It's like Emma Stone in TAS. So creepy it's revolting. They've CGIed the orcs, why not draw some Final Fantasy level humans as well? Lines feel empty, scenes feel awkward(and downright insane to a real fan). Khadgar is a laughing stock. I wonder how will they ruin Thrall later... though that won't happen soon.

If there is anything, even a slightest hint of value in the movie - it's the visuals. But that's just the Legendary Pictures. As much as I despise CGI in movies, I must say - the movie was a fine trailer. Worse than Warcraft 3 or WoW trailers. But still a good chance to see a realistic Warcraft, something WoW engine can't provide. However, if the orcs might have some nature to them, the dwarfs feel like a caricature of the most clichéd fantasy dwarf. Even Hobbit did a better job. Elves feel like plastic action figures with rubber ears.

So... I delayed watching this movie. I tried to relive myself of all hope, I've heard what they say. So I thought I'd watch it with a glad heart... But some things can not be swallowed as a ""summer blockbuster"". It's not Independence Day 2, which I'd popcorn any time.

They might as well have picked Uwe Boll. Can't be any worse.",3
Warcraft,"I still remember the times around 1996, when Warcraft II was my first big computer game love. I didn't know much English, so the story briefings between missions were mostly just a text scrolling upwards. The mission goals also weren't making sense most of the time. But the action was fun! Train a pack of infantry units and send them kill someone. Zug-zug, job's done!

Now, 20 years from then, the Warcraft universe has expanded into a huge cash-making factory, going so far from its RTS roots that it even includes a movie now. Well, the funny thing is, when I was watching that movie, I felt like that ignorant kid again. But this time the game I was offered to play lacked any excitement.

If there's a list of typical fantasy film mistakes, Warcraft has made most of them. The characters are introduced with the same neglect as some game NPCs, leaving you no room to guess why they are what they are and where they are. The plot progresses in a mission-like style, jumping from one location to another with hardly enough glue to put it all together. And the dialogues are an embarrassing mix of fake second-rate epic clichés and equally fake tearjerking tirades compared to which the soap opera drama feels truly Shakespearean. Combined, all of that makes you guess whether Warcraft was an Uwe Boll creation.

It's not that horribly bad though. The cast is rather fresh and not taken from an old moldy and moth-ridden wardrobe. The CGI, although sloppy at times, is up to par and not cheap. And if you really try to turn your brains off while watching it, Warcraft might even be a way to spend two hours without getting bored, especially if you can appreciate its universe and like being given an easter egg once in a while. But don't expect anything beyond that sort of popcorn entertainment, otherwise you risk being bitterly disappointed.",3
Warcraft,"I'm a gamer. I love RPGs. I love fantasy movies. But man, this movie is a mess. The ties to the source materials are flimsy at best. It's just looks like an attempt to grab a few more bucks from the WoW crowd. If it weren't for the WoW apologists (who I appreciate because of my own gaming past) this movie would be rated around the 3 range. The people involved took this movie way too seriously. Sorry, you're not Tolkien. At least take comfort in the fact that this movie isn't as bad as Double Dragon.",3
Warcraft,"Without going too far into spoiler territory this movie tries to cram too much (characters, plot lines, CGI, and side plots) into its 2hr & 3min run time. Not to mention, nonsensical plot elements.

For example the scene where human characters are discussing the how many legions that have been destroyed by the orks. Wait...for a place that has been living in harmony for years (according the dialog said 20 minutes ago) why do the humans have so many legions of troops? Even Rome (at the height of their power) took months to raise a legion at a moments notice. The orks (we are told) took months to bring their clans together. And I'm expected to believe the humans have legions waiting around in peaceful times doing nothing?

I've played WoW from 2004 to 2015. I kinda remember all of the names and factions, but for someone who doesn't know the world I'm sure they are more lost then I was.

The movie rushes from one scene to the other as quickly as possible. This movie gives the audience zero time to breathe & process what's going on. I get no sense of tension because the actors are simply reciting their lines like this was a jr high-school rendition of Wizard of Oz. The actors look as board as I was. The CGI an over the top dazzle fest, & half the time I'm not sure they know what they are interacting with and looked uninterested.

If you want to watch something more entertaining, watch the cut scenes from the original games.",3
Warcraft,"When their world is destroyed, a group of orcs plot to invade the planet Azeroth by using a magic portal. The Orcs have used human prisoners to assist with the creation of this portal. When they become aware of the Orcs plans, a group of human heroes band together to stop the Orcs from taking over their planet. However, some of the Orcs are unhappy with their leader Gul'dan's regime and plans for the humans and band together with the humans to try to overthrow both him and his loyal followers.

It's hard to really know where to begin writing a review about Warcraft: The Beginning as, for me, it was a film that was flawed across a wide range of areas...

For starters, the story is muddled and not particularly well-explained - I haven't played the video game so I knew next to nothing about this film before I started watching it. The picture has very little depth and at no point does it really give us much insight into both the humans world and the Orcs world. It also doesn't really help that the characters are not really developed and had there been some kind of camaraderie between the characters then this may have made the film just about 'watchable'. But herein lies the problem, both the characters and the story are painfully dull, the dialogue is fairly weak and I actually found myself bored at several points during the film. If the villains, heroes and story are not given any kind of focus or development why should I care about anything that happens?

As I mentioned above, what 'story' there is here seems to have been thrown together with very little thought or care. The film shunts backwards and forwards, the film moves from one action scene to another and one character to another but it doesn't do any of this in a way that feels logical. The action scenes are quite good and do give the film bursts of energy from time to time, but the editing and the way that the whole film has been put together takes away more than it adds and it just started giving me a headache towards the end.

The only minor saving grace with this film lies with the acting and the likes of Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster were both excellent. As I've mentioned some of the battles give the film a much needed boost of energy, but the whole thing is so sloppily structured that it ultimately feels like a lot of hard work has gone to waste.

The truly sad thing is that I can actually see a decent story in amongst this mess of a film, but Jones never allows it to truly develop and he also gives many of the characters nothing to do and their lack of camaraderie really hurts the film. It's a bit of a shambles and really does waste nearly all of its potential.",3
Warcraft,"If you play battle games you may enjoy this. It is based on a game but somehow people rate this as good for a film.

I don't rate it at all. There is no real storyline and the characters are 2d. Basically actors walk around a cgi set and technicians do the effects. There is no acting and there are no characters. The roles are very cardboard cutout with no personality and no subtlety or humour.

So if you are 14 and male you may enjoy it as a film. If you love the game you may enjoy it. However, if you don't then it's doubtful.

Ignore reviews from other people comparing it to Lord of The Rings and GOT. You would be better comparing it with Noddy and Bigears go to War. There is no comparison with either as there is no storyline and there are no characters. Oh, I guess there are orcs. Thats really the only similarity.",3
Warcraft,"Fantasy has not had a great history of cinema with the exception of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. Video game adaptations have an even more dubious history. Warcraft melds the two genres into a terrible movie that has very few redeeming qualities. One thing about the movie that I did enjoy were the special effects. The film does a great job making the Orcs look real and humanizing them despite being CGI characters.

The genre has not attracted the finest actors but Travis Fimmel is passable as the protagonist just as long as he doesn't have to show any real emotions. There are a few parts where he is supposed to be sad that just come off as ridiculous but he takes his humor and Vikings experience to elevated his game just a little bit. The rest of the cast is awful from Paula Patton as the half-orc/half-human mumbling over her fake teeth or Ben Foster doing a poor impression of Gandalf. It does not bode well for the so far somewhat disappointing Preacher comic TV show adaptation that the two lead actors Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga show up in this movie and phone in performances.

Warcraft,"Well, if you are one of those people who've asked themselves, why has Jesus forsaken the world, and when is he coming back?! Your answers are, because of ""Warcraft"" and never.

I am not familiar with the game (games?!), so I am not judging them. The movie, while based on the game and perhaps appealing primarily to that fan base, should also try, at least try, to appeal to wider audiences who are perhaps not familiar with it.

Well it doesn't! This movie is unforgivingly boring, the cast is sub par and so is the acting...the directing and the production values are just underwhelming! Besides, seeing Ruth Negga and Dominic Cooper share the screen yet again, I can see why the TV series ""Preacher"" over on AMC sucks...

""Warcraft"" also amounts to visual plagiarism of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" movies...something it doesn't even try to hide.

I had high hopes, then just hope, then reasonable expectations, that ""Warcraft"" would deliver the kind of fun, well made, summer popcorn movie entertainment we've been missing. But it doesn't do any of those things. Instead ""Warcraft"" joins a long line of lame, crummy, lacklustre and failed video game adaptations.

I think that Jesus saw this movie...and suddenly realized he died for nothing, so he said ""F **k it!"" and then cancelled the Second Coming...

""Warcraft"" is basically larping with a $170 million dollars budget!",3
Warcraft,"Mediocre story, absolutely terrible cast and acting (someone should have told Travis Fimmel that he's not filming vikings and should act out a different character), and every scene that included real people and wasn't completely CGI looked about as realistic as the Dungeons&Dragons movies.

The only good thing is that Durotan and his fellow orcs were animated beautifully, with extreme love for detail. The facial animations, as subtle as they were done sometimes, made Durotan more believable than any characters played by actual actors.

Honestly I expected nothing and was still disappointed. Wouldn't bother watching again.",3
Warcraft,"World of Warcraft is one of the most successful video game franchises of all time, I've never played it myself, I've just seen images and heard of the fandom, and seen both spoofed in a hilarious episode of South Park, I went to see this because it had a good trailer, directed by the late great David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code). Basically the lush world of Azeroth, occupied by human and dwarf people, had been peaceful for a long time, but then orcs escaped their dying home world of Draenor, travelling through a portal activated by magic into this new land. Since then the Azeroth civilisation and the orcs have been strong opponents, orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell), the Frostwolf clan chieftain, only wants to save his people, including mate Draka (Anna Galvin) who gave birth to their son after they entered the kingdom. Durotan is prepared if necessary to attempt to make peace with the enemy, but green-skinned orc Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), who possesses evil powers, wants to take over the kingdom. Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), the military commander of the kingdom of Stormwind, King Magni Bronzebeard (Michael Adamthwaite), dwarf ruler of Ironforge, and Llane Wrynn, King of Stormwind (Dominic Cooper) are among the characters either to find a way to create peace between the two sides, or indeed a way to defend themselves from the oncoming collision. This includes the introduction of a weapon called the Boomstick (a gun), and consulting Medivh (Ben Foster), the fabled Guardian, of course the friction between the two sides, the Alliance and the Horde, is increased, and with magic brought into the equation the situation intensifies when they go into battle. Also starring Paula Patton as Garona (who appears to be half-human and half-orc), Ben Schnetzer as Khadgar, EastEnders' Robert Kazinsky as Orgrim, Ruth Negga as Lady Taria, Clancy Brown as Blackhand and Callum Keith Rennie as Moroes. Computer geeks across the world must have been excited to hear there was going be a movie adaptation of this phenomenon, unfortunately this follows in the footsteps of Super Mario Bros., Tomb Raider and Doom, it based on a video game that millions have played, but even the connoisseurs will be let down by the result. There is so much going on, underdeveloped characters and a flimsy plot, that I lost my way many times, you cannot deny that the special effects to create the many mythical creatures and bring to life the engaging climactic battles are amazing, but that's about it, unfortunately it is a fairly boring and disappointing fantasy film. Adequate!",3
Warcraft,"The history of video game movies is torrid, but Warcraft seemed like the film to break the curse. The publishers were involved with the film's production, the franchise had a rich lore to draw on, and it was directed by Duncan Jones who was a director on the rise. However, Warcraft was a critical disaster and nowhere near as profitable as everyone hoped it would be.

Warcraft felt more like a three-hour film or a season of a TV show condensed into less than two hours. It had too many characters and plotlines. It either needed a simpler narrative or needed more of a run time. It was a film that focused on world-building and setting up the franchise.

There were some decent ideas. The Horde were the more interesting faction because they teleported to Azeroth out of desperation and they were shown to have a noble, warrior culture. They weren't simple beings of evil like in Lord of the Rings. The motion capture for the Orcs was fantastic and Toby Kebbell and Robert Kazinsky were the best actors in the film. There were so decent battle sequences, like the final battle.

However, there were big issues. The setting looked like a theme park, it was too clean and pristine. Compared it to Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and Pirates of the Caribbean where those worlds felt lived in. There was also so bizarre casting choices with some actors speaking in ill-fitting American accents. It made the film feel more like a cheap TV show.",3
Warcraft,"It's hard to take this film seriously, or even see it as an installment to the Warcraft franchise. To older fans of a now twenty plus year old franchise, it might just seem like a bad parody video on Youtube. To newer fans, it may seem wonderful because they believe its reigniting the legacy of a franchise's heyday they were never around for. To those uninitiated with the story at all, it may just feel like yet another bad fantasy flick on par with Gods of Egypt or Wrath of the Titans made for children.

A severely diluted and inaccurate retelling of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, one might wonder what the point of this film even was. Why go through the effort to dramatically change it for the worst, and deliver it through poor dialogue executed through overacting which starred actors who might not even be considered B List quality? We're introduced to bland and dry humans who wear bad Ren Faire garb or armor that is humorously far more ornate and impractical than what we even see in the games (which is accompanied with an excessive amount of post-production metallic clanking sound effects), and to contradicting and superficial orcs donned in pseudo-primitive attire rendered so poorly that you might begin to question the effectiveness of motion capture. Through superfluous narrative, the plot thrusts us from one green screen sound stage to the next, barely giving us time to garner a sense of atmosphere as we're whisked away within three to five minutes to yet another random locale. To those unfamiliar with the franchise, they're never likely to remember the goofy names or nomenclature of the characters and unique story elements, and they're undoubtedly lost in the sheer amount of backstory that's never unveiled but simply implied to fans who spent years soaking it all up. The CGI rendering of the inhuman races (sans elves) might make one question the wisdom in such a decision; to waste more money on rendering them, rather than simply using practical effects and costumes on appropriate actors as has been done in fantasy films prior. The elves in question might present an answer to that, as they appeared to be shoddy quality cosplayers with poorly fabricated latex ears, foam fantasy outfits, bad wigs and LED light contact eye lenses. The question as to whether this will prevail over the likes of Lord of the Rings or not is quite evident: it will not. Lord of the Rings provided great immersion for longtime fans, while Warcraft could hardly make one believe any of it; from the over usage of huge light show spectacles for otherwise simple magical spells to incoherent plot progression and more than questionable (or confusing) character decisions, it's certainly not going to dethrone the LotR films anytime soon.

When it all boils down to the future of this film venture, the franchise could only continue if it willfully alienates those who have never played the games and caters strictly to those who know the wide berth of backstory, as the vast amount of plot holes and unanswered questions can only worsen as they delve into the stories of the later games, which feature far more plot elements which the filmmakers could never squeeze into the respective subsequent films. While at the same time, how soon could we expect to see a sequel, given the production hell this very film endured, and the divided response it garnered? If not for China, this film may very well have failed to break budget, as it hasn't even grossed three times what it cost in total. Given Legendary Pictures was acquired by a Chinese production company during the production of this film, what fans this film has garnered may be relieved if a sequel is produced if just because of the positive interest the Chinese audience has shown in this film, as undoubtedly no American company would trust a sequel to succeed based on the poor domestic US box office results.",3
Warcraft,"Let's get right to the point. The Warcraft movie is bad. It's really bad. I wanted to like this movie but it's just not a good movie. The acting is beyond horrible. Especially the main human cast. The CG orcs act circles around the humans in this movie. The movie also does a horrible job of explaining the world to the audience. Thank God I actually know the lore of Warcraft and love the games otherwise I might have just walked out on the movie. The tone in the movie is all over the place too. On the orc side of things with Durotan it's fine but on the human side they try to insert some witty banter which just falls flat, a ""romance"" that is beyond forced, and finally some tragedy which they simply have not earned. The CG is really uneven. Sometimes it's damn impressive and other times it's flat out bad. All this makes for a pretty terrible movie experience. Sure, fans of Warcraft will probably enjoy it but that doesn't make Warcraft a good movie, just like Twilight fans enjoying the Twilight movies don't make those movies good movies. If you go into this movie as a Warcraft fan you'll probably enjoy yourself but if you're looking for a good fantasy movie, like Lord of The Rings, then stay far away from this movie.",3
Warcraft,"One memory that will last from college was simply passing through my dormitory. Why that? Because most of the open doors became ironic statements when most of the students were at their desks with headphones in as they placed themselves in a fantasy world. This adventure they were a part of was the World of Warcraft. While I've seen it and even saw the episode tribute on South Park, I have never played the online sensation that still remains one of the biggest selling computer games of all time. Like anything popular, Hollywood is going to want to take a shot at it at some point.

The issue once again is that Hollywood has a terrible track record for video game movies. Hit-man: Agent 47 and Ratchet and Clank have proved that the material is simply incompliant in a cinematic light. Is it the people making the game? Is the people in front of the camera? It's hard to say, so Blizzard, the company behind World of Warcraft, has taken more a production role to try and ensure a proper adaptation. They've even hired Duncan Jones, the creative genius behind Moon and Source Code. With the game company and a good director in tow, does Warcraft finally crack the video game adaptation problem?

We begin in the fictional world of the orcs, Dreanor, where the planet is dying. Several orc clans follow the direction Gul'dan (played by Daniel Wu) and his magic through a portal that leads them into Durotan, the world of the humans. One of the orcs that made it, Durotan (played by Toby Kebbell) joins Gul'dan's war band as they raid several villages to take the land in their name. The humans of this world are a part of a medieval kingdom as run by King Llane Wrynn (played by Dominic Cooper).

Top knight commander Sir Anduin Lothar (played by Travis Fimmel) does his best to strategize against the bigger orcs which prove to be a bigger problem then anticipated. He starts to work with a mage (magical person) Khadgar (played by Ben Schnetzer) who consult the guardian wizard Medivh (played by Ben Foster). They gain their first clue when they can trace bits of the magic that the orcs have been using. While scouting, they encounter a half-orc woman Ganrona (played by Paula Patton) whose caught in the middle of this invasion. Meanwhile, Khadgar is questioning the intentions of Gul'dan as both sides face each other for the first time.

Did you get all of that? I hope so, because Warcraft spews A LOT of fantasy elements that I assume are from the source material. I'll take a wild guess that the movie follows the game very closely, because this made me feel like the guy coming to a comic shop trying to eves drop on a bigger group of fans trying to understand what their talking about. The problem here is definitely the script that has trouble trying to create some history and understanding of the orcs. This seems like the best thing would to have simply made the villains evil.

Now what's interesting is that the orcs are the best element in Warcraft. The motion-capture and CGI is some of the best I've seen. They way the skin tones react to the light really make you forget your watching animated characters. The story of orc Durotan was the most intriguing side to hear from, so why couldn't they have done the same for the humans. I could care for any of these people cause all, not some, but all of the human actors were terrible. They only got good when the battle sequences happened, which were also well staged and shot.

I'll give this three copies of World of Warcraft out of ten. If the other video game movies made the mistake of hiring a director with little knowledge of the source, then this is the other extreme; hiring someone who can't translate everything into an entertaining fantasy movie. Warcraft had a lot of potential but will be seen as too much work for a mainstream audience. Even if I did know the material, I doubt the movie would still be good.",3
Warcraft,"I have played Warcraft and I used to love it (""Used to"" because I don't play it anymore). So when I heard they were making a movie I was semi- excited because I knew then and there that it would take a miracle to bring all the characters, races and different story lines of the game into one movie. I expected to be disappointed and I was half right. The first half of the movie was okay but the second half was just a mix and mash of random plot points and a concoction ideas poured into a mold to fit the narrative. The ending seemed rushed and forced. In fact, I was surprised it got this many stars on IMDb (must be all the gamers and fanboys, but I don't blame them). The movie could have done with better story depth, deeper character development, better acting and many more. The CGI absolutely amazing on the other hand.

The filmmakers should have taken it slow and made a trilogy.",4
Warcraft,"I really wanted to like this movie, having been a fan of the games a few years back, but this movie really missed the mark. In my remarks, I will discuss key elements of the plot, which is why I gave it a Spoiler Alert. If you don't want to know certain elements of the story, then don't read any further.

The big problem with this movie is the storyline, which moves far too fast, and tries to encompass far too much. We end up getting little glimpses of a lot of characters, but don't get to know any of them. The character of Garona (played by Paula Patton) is a good example.

We are introduced to Garona fairly early in the movie, and realize she is ""half-orc"". (It's the green skin and the fangs that give it away.) She seems like she would have been a great character to revolve the story around, yet we learn next to nothing about her. Who were her parents? Her mother, she said, was put to death, but who was her father? How did she end up being tugged along in chains beside the orc hoard, and why was she there at all. Why drag along a half-orc slave girl when you are attacking a new world? Was it her language abilities? We were never told, so can only surmise.

Then Garona falls into the hands of the human leadership, who suddenly treat her like a long lost friend. They trust her so completely that she gets to wander alone freely throughout the castle, even down to the dungeons to chat with Anduin. At the end of the movie, she becomes paired with the king in the final battle. She vows to Anduin that she will ""protect the king"", yet we are never told why the king would rely on her protection in the first place. In a matter of days, and the timeline of this movie encompasses no more then that, Garona goes from a slave girl on a completely different world, to suddenly becoming a close confidant of the royalty of the kingdom. They never show us how this sudden relationship growth takes place, or why she would feel such loyalty and affection for a King that she just met.

The movie shows us little snippets that suggests that there is a budding romance forming between Anduin and Garona, but leaves that hanging as well, with nothing being resolved. Anduin, for his part, seems attracted to Garona, but again, he never really tells her. Just a lot of staring and mumbling on his part. In the end, Garona remains a complete enigma, which prevents the audience from feeling any kind of attachment to her.

So many elements of this movie are just thrown at the audience, who are simply expected to suddenly grasp the significance of characters and situations. Ben Foster's character, Medivh, is thrown at us with the explanation that he is ""The Guardian"". We don't know what or who the Guardian is, and it is never explained, so there is a disconnect. Then there is the young magician, Khadgar, played unconvincingly by Ben Schnetzer. We don't know anything about his origins except that he ran away from some school that we have to assume is for mages. Assume, again, because we are frustratingly not told anything. The movie drops these characters in our laps and then just moves on.

The Lord of the Rings demonstrated how to introduce an ensemble cast so that the audience would identify with the various characters, and care what happens to them. All of that is missing from Warcraft: The Beginning. This movie just tosses us back and forth between the orcs, the humans, the mages, back to the good orcs, then over to the bad orcs, and then back to the humans once again. Around and around like a merry-go-round, with not one single character being fully developed enough to care about.

Positive: Good CG effects.

Negative: Pretty much everything else.",4
Warcraft,This film is boring.The story is beautiful but the scenes make boring the film.The characters are quite detailed.,4
Warcraft,"I played and loved the very first WarCraft game and am a big fan of Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster. I appreciate that a lot of money was spent on the special effects. But this is a cheesy two hour digital cartoon video game trailer for children, not a serious movie. Bad script, dialogue, undeveloped characters, hollow performances, rushed editing. A waste of excellent acting talent. The dwarves and elves looked silly. Felt like almost the entire movie was CGI or green screen. The orcs are just too fake to take seriously, resulting in a pompous, clumsy, gigantic piece of fool's gold.",4
Warcraft,"Films such as ""Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Narnia"" trilogy have allowed, over the last two decades, significantly, an avalanche of fantasy and adventure films that, in a way, are inspired by these main works and try to innovate with other source material. In this case, the source material is ""Warcraft"", an extremely successful video game series that chronicles the clash between humans and invading orcs in the fantastical universe of Azeroth.

When I picked up this movie, kind of curious about the name and a brief description, I didn't know it was a movie inspired by the world of computer games. I confess that it is not the type of film I like the most, most of the time the films are of inferior quality and have little interest stories. This film does not escape this norm much: the script is good, as far as we are willing to accept it, but the story told and the film, as a global work, lack emotion, soul and life. It's an uninteresting film, visually showy and elegant, but it doesn't know how to hold our attention with a really good story.

From the human cast, I would highlight the positive work of Ben Foster, Travis Fimmel, Dominic Cooper and Paula Patton. Without their efforts, the film would inevitably be more artificial and boring. Still, no actor has done a remarkable job and the cast effort is bland. The orcs are, for the most part, graphic figures that someone has lent their voice to, well distorted digitally.

It is the technical aspects that the film truly bets on: through the overwhelming use of CGI and high technology, the film brings us a realistic and visually spectacular Azeroth, as you would expect in a film based on a video game. The visuals and sound effects are very good, and the combat scenes are epic, with armies fighting each other realistically and a welcome dose of action. The costumes used by the human cast are detailed and are fully in keeping with the rest of the film.",4
Warcraft,"Completely ignoring all the retconning from the original WC1-3 lore, the story itself is a mess and clumsily told. It does 100% ""tell, don't show"", and proceeds to have characters say and do nonsensical things, from start till the end.

A few examples of this: Durotan: Fel magic is evil, but we had no way of knowing that. Now, allow me to do what this CLEARLY evil sorcerer, who has green skin and green glowing eyes, spikes coming out of his back and arms and a evil voice, says. Slaughter innocents and kids? Sure thing, Gul'dan! Wait, the fel is evil? WhaaAAAAaaaat???!

Medivh: I'll make a big golem, which can't leave the room or roam the tower because of it's big size, with the exact purpose to leave the room and clean - Which it can't. Small thing, but why did he say that?

Blackhand: Why did you bring a pregnant orc with you through the portal, Durotan? Oh well, I guess Im okay with it now, because Gul'dan wanted more warriors for the Horde.

Also, why is Thrall born green? His mum and dad are still brown....?

It's badly paced, and the effects, even its part real actors and part CG, are terrible. Fans have asked (Not just asked, but begged) for a full feature CG movie by Blizzard, for decades - This was their chance, and they screwed it up, big time - Partly by making it with real actors, instead of all CG. You are introduced to a bazzilion different characters, and before any of them are even established with motivations and depth, the movie acts as if you really care about them, or what they are trying to do. The movie is rushed and feels like a 2 hour long fan service - BAD fan service. It's just name dropping characters, places, and factions left and right, with very little context or depth.

Having Khadgar essentially reduced to being little more than comedical relief is just a slap in the face. And comedy isn't a requirement in movies, guys. If it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. Again, it feels forced.

Honestly, this movie feels and looks an awful lot like a fan fiction-movie. If that was indeed the case, I would had gone easier on it. But given that it is, in fact, a big and expensive movie, that cost 160 MILLION US DOLLARS, the quality of the effect and the script, is just not good - It's that simple.

By the climax and the duel between Durotan and Gul'dan, I think the movie gets confused about which side of the portal we're looking at: The humans are at the portal, at a place that looks like a forest, or a jungle (Tanaan Jungle, I would guess). But the azeroth side would not be a jungle - It would be a swamp (Black Morass. Later Blasted Lands). It is actually the Outland side that would be a jungle (Tanaan Jungle).

So, this is actually really confusing at this point in the movie, because the movie itself doesn't seem to know where the characters are or where the events are taking place - Whether it's in the orc world (Outlands), or the human world (Azeroth).

All in all, the movie just doesn't work. Not as a movie for fans, not as a movie adaption. It doesn't even work as a movie, in general.

Warcraft,"there were so many things wrong with this movie, that I told my buddy how embarrassed I was to be watching it without any of my own children. It turns out that this was a date movie for some and that quite a few people were interested in seeing this. I wonder if they saw what I saw. I didn't know that there would be some somewhat entertaining actors in this film, and good thing for IMDb for being able to search other work that they have done as well... but from what I saw...it wasn't too different from a dinosaur movie that came out not too long ago where the triceratops bros....fight. This does happen to be a little more mature and is even better than the Jungle book...which I know that I definitely should not take any children to see. The generic film is obvious...the theatre and quality of FILM changes multiple times...scenes with JUST THREE people on screen, one dude with a blue towel wrapped around him...etcetera. there's this scene where the KING intimately tells a woman ork to do something...and THOUGH she does it, no one else had had the opportunity to KNOW that that conversation happened amongst them....THEREFORE and ultimately creating a scenario of THEM against YOU with out any explanations...",4
Warcraft,"I cannot like a movie which makes a complete mess out of the official history of Warcraft. I can only compare Blizzard Entertainment's lack of interest with the idea of Peter Jackson refusing to film The Two Towers and skipping from the first movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the third. (To avoid any uncertainties, the Warcraft movie presents the events of the first Warcraft game.) The movie's ending however makes half of the history in the second Warcraft game improbable. On to the second most frustrating detail. The main antagonist is a tyrant, what would make for a good drama, if only the official story did not present him merely as a schemer. This behavior is forced upon the story, leading to events that were also unimaginable in the official lore, but with no lasting impact. So the movie concentrates on presenting these and the origins of the Dark Portal instead of the actual war. In fact in official history none of the battles from the movie have happened. The only explanation I can muster for this is that the movie is oriented towards the age group playing World of Warcraft and Blizzard Entertainment considered the original history of Warcraft I to be too tragic for that audience. People who haven't played WoW received flashes of possibly familiar content from the franchise such as brutish orcs and soldiers of Stormwind to get them excited about the game and the rest of the audience, who may have actually grown up on this story may go and hang themselves. I'm not one to frequently spot poor acting or poor CGI, so except the fact that Lothar looks nothing like his game version, I don't have an opinion on those. The movie gives me a glimmer of hope, that Blizzard will one day realize, that warriors want to be able to see their surroundings, so will not wear shoulder pads that obstruct their vision, but Blackhand's armor-decorations thus far elude logic. I consider the soundtrack to be about average. I've seen many mediocre movies saved by their soundtrack but Warcraft is not one of them. So my score would look like this: visuals 8 (at least it's not the kaleidoscope we see in World of Warcraft), acting 6, soundtrack 7 and story 3. The story and acting should weigh more in the final score in my opinion, so the average would be somewhere around 4.",4
Warcraft,"Opinions are clearly divided about this movie, so I will keep my criticism to a few points:

This movie drags. The pacing is really uneven, even though the plot seems to be pretty lean. Perhaps its the large cast, so the action is always jumping around to contend with different threads. Eventually a lot of it isn't surprising and a number of twists get telegraphed way in advance.


Travis Fimmel phones it in, which is a problem since he is the lead. He also appears to often be the comic relief, which is an issue since he is one of the tragic characters as well. His jokes mainly fall flat. Contrasted to his role in vikings, there is none of the screen chemistry that makes him so watchable.",4
Warcraft,"I wasn't expecting Lord of the Rings or a movie which strictly adhered to Warcraft lore. I was hoping for a good story populated with relatable characters. I was disappointed in that I saw neither.

The movie had no sense of itself or what it wanted to do. I felt like it was trying too hard to appeal to a broad audience and lost itself in the process.

There's a kind of charm to all the characters in the game that wasn't there in the movie. In the game, there's winks and nods in the form of pop culture references and humor abounds. This movie took itself way too seriously and what few stabs it made at humor fell terribly flat. I felt like the movie was saying, ""I am epic! See how epic I am? Behold all my epicness! I am SOOOOO EPIC!... Ummm... do you think I'm epic?""

I had a very difficult time getting invested in the characters. When key characters died I found myself saying, ""So?"" and ""Who was that again?"" I believe the pacing was to blame along with splitting the viewer's attention between so many groups of people. I have to agree with other reviewers and say that I cared more about The Frostwolf Clan and Durotan than I did about anyone else. No offense to the actors playing human characters, but I thought they lacked charisma. It felt like they pulled actors out of a ren-fair and handed them a script.

Finally, the plot was convoluted. We were dropped in the middle of the Orc's exodus to Azeroth with no exposition. From there, we were jetted from locale to locale unsure of why we went there or where we were going next.

It's not Marlan Wayans Dungeons and Dragons bad. The acting was OK, the action was good, and they threw in a merloc so I'll bump it a point for that. All in all, I'm giving it a 4.",4

Warcraft,"This is a terrible movie, that's also incredibly messy and made little sense while choking on its own umbilical cord. Warcraft is all over the place. It has no focus, and its story suffers greatly from a sequence of events that come together about as well as dipping sushi in ketchup.

Maybe fans of the Warcraft game understood what the hell was going on in this film, but the rest of us were wondering ""WTF"" during ""WTB"" (Warcraft: The Beginning). The character developments were also ridiculously flat. The relationships had absolutely no life; Anduin and his son. Anduin and Garona. The king ad his queen. Anduin and his sister. Anduin and the king. This list of these half to barely developed run-of-the-mill characters and more so, relationships, could really span almost, if not the entire cast.

The CGI started off okay to good, then of course as the movie progressed, the intensity and necessity of the visual effects grew, and unfortunately, grew beyond the films budget and/or the director's ability to create the world he needed to. Warcraft was CGI heavy, extremely so, and that made it run the risk of starting to feel cartoonish, unrealistic, and even worse, fake. The Green Screens are so obvious, especially at the end when the Guardian to be guy was handing a sword to Anduin, amongst many other parts in this film.

The fight sequences were meh. The acting was meh. The composition was meh. The directing and cinematography, meh. Visual effects, meh. The editing... Meh. 4.4/10.",4
Warcraft,"This is probably the nerdiest film I have ever seen, which I find endearing as somebody who is a fan of franchises that hold such a shamelessly niche appeal. And on that point, my biggest praise I can give this film is that the aesthetics are completely loyal to how the games look and feel. However, this and the fairly competent action direction don't make up for the rest of this film feeling so empty. It has the most basic of plot-lines, the world-building doesn't expand much beyond the occasional fan-pandering, and an ending that is completely pointless beyond the set up for a sequel we will probably never see. I should probably hate this more than I do, but I left with less of a sour taste in my mouth as much as I did with an unanswered query: who is this for?!

Apparently Cooper wasn't sure if he had to play a king or a very bored weather forecast, while Schnetzer seemed to be simply not able to bring any depth into his acting. Whatever happened on screen, he was the goofy sidekick.

Around that time I started getting frustrated with the story. Scenes drag out hoping to increase tension or anticipation but made me impatient instead and ultimately unsatisfied. The way the movie ends is especially frustrating...

I don't want to give any spoilers but I do want to warn viewers that this has a complete ""to be continued"" ending, like The Fellowship of the Ring. But in The Fellowship you know there are two more parts and the books are very well known. Where is part two of Warcraft? Did they make this assuming they would make another or was it aimed at just superfans of Warcraft? They could have made a more satisfying ending while still leaving the viewer wanting more, like countless other movies.",4
Warcraft,"Alright, so I'm a big fan of the Warcraft universe and it's rich lore. I immensely enjoyed the olden times before the story line was crapped on with silly plots like time travel etc. Even so, I have to admit that this is simply not a good movie. The fault lies mainly in the fact that this is a story written for video games like Starcraft, Warcraft 3 etc. It's structure is based on you experiencing most of the story through the narrative and the eyes of it's many heroes, that you also get to control from time to time. You invest a big amount of time and effort in helping them and assuring their safety, only to watch them being torn away or having to make huge sacrifices for the greater good. This works in games and also in books because you spend such a long time alongside them and part-take in their personal development. In the film they pop up, you see them for a relatively short amount of time and you really don't care too much about them. There are also too many of them. The movie bases almost entirely on the relationships people built to the characters in previous times. The fact that the story is the main protagonist and not really any of the characters on their own, also contributes to the failing of the Warcraft universe on the big screen. I fear this might have halted the performance of the actors, which was quite varying to say the least. I was also really puzzled by how easily some characters put their thrust in others without having any reasons for doing so. This is the fallacy of WoW, where the players gain trust quite easily from characters because it's how it needs to be to have progression contents. It doesn't work in a film. Even so I will admit that I enjoyed myself a lot of the time, getting to see many of the zones I've spend countless hours traveling and exploring. There are so many nods to the vanilla and TBC-times in WoW that people will be constantly giggling in their seats.

The timing of this movie is perfect as WoW is seeing a steep decline in subscribers lately. The fact that it has a built-in audience of +-100 million people will surely help the franchise keep afloat for a while longer. There's also some elements of WoD in it, almost like they made the expansion to cater to the updated script of the film. Sadly this also gives a sour feeling that a lot of the development effort was put into the movie rather than the game, where it was badly needed. There are also more than enough nods towards the new Legion-expansion expected later this year. This will surely help Renew the passion for the Warcraft universe for at least a few months more.

Should I watch this film if I enjoyed the Warcraft games? Most probably, even if it'll feel somewhat shallow at times.

Should I watch this film if I didn't? No, this is pure fan-service.

Will Warcraft make loads of $$$ even if it's not that good a movie? Yes. It'll probably be among the highest grossing movies with such a bad script.",4
Warcraft,"After Terminator, Star Wars, X-Men (which I saw before) now this really bad adaptation to cinema of such an epic game. At the time I am writing this, GhostBusters is out already so it is really a complete 2016 dismal.

Please stop making movies in 2016, not a single one worth more than 6, maybe Avengers was not so crappy.

I don't know what is wrong with directors now days but the first thing they should do before shooting a scene was to actually have a coherent script, at least without major flaws.

When talking about game based movies they should play the game, talk with gamers and try to see what was so appealing about the game.

For example the Orcs Necromancers could summon undead, they also had Ogres in the Horde and not a single view of ballistas nor catapults, and specially of Beserkers if want just straight forward Orc infantry.

I mean I think you can impress 5,6 years old with this but or people that likes Batman vs Superman crap but I really cannot believe a single fan of Warcraft liked it.

Go back to direction school 2016 directors, shame on you...",4
Warcraft,"If a title that strong as Warcraft is taken for a movie, you better prepare a good one! And here, even without the whole 'being a Warcraft' glamour, this is a pretty weak movie! The plots are easy to predict, the acting is below average, the dialogues don't build anything, and the whole story does not pull one into it making it a movie that you want to see till the end. I would say you wait for the end, but for the wrong reasons - for it to end, and not to see what happens in the end. Will a fantasy fan watch it with pleasure? Not sure. Will a movie lover watch it with pleasure? For sure no. One thing good about the movie, is that when you think (and there are numerous places where you encounter such scenes) that something in the movie will happen that will make the film a complete disaster, this does not happen. But man - should we praise a movie for that?",4
Warcraft,"In short: too much CGI, a boring story, boring characters, long-stretched battles.

Well, you get everything a fantasy and action fan craves for - beautiful pictures, great heroes and battles and stuff but somehow in this movie everything just looks and feels like a cliché and made without care. If you got a dish you taste if a cook is cooking with care to details and he likes his job and tries to surprise and please you or if he is just doing everything by the books like an automate. That's somehow how Warcraft hit me - everything is here but it tastes like convenience food: artificial and boring to the tongue and mind.

Recommendation only for fans of the game/franchise and/or fantasy die-hards.",4
Warcraft,"Having never played the War of Warcraft video games, I knew nothing about the gaming world. The film adaptation boasts great special effects which concerns Orcs escaping their dying world and invade the world of Azeroth. The human inhabitants of Azeroth try to stop them.

The trouble is that the Lord of the Rings made this film more exciting and involving. I could not really get into this film despite the interesting opening and immersive world created by director Duncan Jones. The film just gets bogged down making it boring and derivative. At least Ben Foster stands out, many of the other actors just come across as humdrum even Paula Patton in what should had been an interesting role as the green-skinned Garona Halforcen.",4
Warcraft,"It was only a matter of time before the massive online role-playing game World of Warcraft was adapted for the big screen. With high fantasy still hugely popular thanks to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies and HBO's Game of Thrones, now seemed the ideal time to bring Warcraft's world of orcs, mages, trolls and elves to the cinema-going audience. Yet even with a talented director at the helm, Duncan Jones, Warcraft flopped hard domestically, but proved such a smash-hit in China that there's now talk of a sequel tailored solely for the Chinese market. That little factoid, symbolic of the increasing importance of overseas box- office to U.S. productions, is probably the only interesting thing to emerge from the film.

Somewhere in this tale of giant green orcs, giant grey orcs, magical portals, hairy men, hairier mages, grumpy dwarfs and huge CGI battles, there's the faint whiff of a plot that focuses on both sides of a war between the peaceful humans and a brutal hoard of orcs. In order to cater for us noobs - those of us who have never spent days slurping energy drinks and munching on Doritos in front of our computer playing the game - writers Jones and Charles Leavitt spend most of the film explaining this world to us and the many factions that operate within it. The main focus on both sides of the battle is Durotan (Toby Kebbell), an orc chieftain with a pregnant partner, and Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), a stock warrior-type with a charisma vacuum.

Durotan is under the command of warlock Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), who has already sucked the life out of one world using a dangerous magic called 'fel' and has used sorcery to open a portal into the next world, Azeroth. Lothar, observing the devastation caused by one of their attacks, comes across mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), who wants to bring the traces of fel to the attention of Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) and the king Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper). When an orc scouting party are beaten by Lothar and his fellow humans, they capture half-orc slave Garona (Paula Patton) and send Durotan back to the hoard defeated. However, seeing the devastation Gul'dan is causing to the land and his dismissal of honourable orc tradition, Durotan secretly plans to team up with the humans to defeat the evil tyrant and free his people.

I actually quite enjoyed the opening 30 minutes of Warcraft. Unhappy with portraying yet another man vs. evil orcs story, Jones' decision to give them both a voice is a breathe of fresh air. But this thoughtful approach quickly gives away to a textbook of clichés, from the humble warrior with a great destiny to the annoying young sidekick who just may be the one to save them all. And don't expect a complete film, as the 'Beginning' in the title means exactly that. Clearly the film-makers were banking on squeezing a trilogy out of this, and don't bother to give us an actual conclusion that would make us want to see a next instalment. With daft names that anyone unfamiliar with the world of Azeroth won't remember, you'll be too busy trying to figure out what's going on to care about many of the characters, with only Kebbell - delivering another impressive motion-capture performance - and Foster getting through it with their reputation in tact. And so the search for a decent video game adaptation goes on.",4
Warcraft,"The fact that Warcraft, the long mooted and eagerly anticipated adaptation of Blizzard Entertainment's industry dominating video game of the same name failed so miserably upon release (saved at the box office by an outstanding display in China) is both sad for the continued disappointment of video game to movie adaptations and also the career of director Duncan Jones.

The viability and reasoning of turning video games into movie entertainment has, and will, be rightfully debated as we head forward on the back of this highest profile experience that failed to ignite the movie going public's imagination and it's a shame that Jones, the son of David Bowie and the man responsible for the Sci-Fi classic Moon has helmed this project he was so passionate about.

Its not hard to see what attracted him to the universe that has enthralled millions for many moons, but along with his screen writing partner Charles Leavitt, Jones has tried but failed to capture what's so appealing about these fantasy lands to the big screen.

Perhaps unfairly labelled by many before release as not only the biggest chance for video game movies to succeed but a new trilogy to rival LOTR, Warcraft had not only the weight of long time fanatics riding on its shoulders but a general public expecting the characters, spectacle and experience that we were so lucky to have with Peter Jackson's masterful series. Jones, though, seems out of his depth to handle all the various elements of the huge universe and the film's runtime that comes in under 2 hours feels rushed and unfulfilled, as we're thrown into a world filled with orcs, guardians and people in green makeup with some token prosthetic tusks.

We never get the connection we almost instantaneously felt towards say Frodo and his merry band, as Jones gives us Vikings Travis Fimmel's fearsome warrior Anduin Lothar, Toby Kebbell's (continuing on his quest to become the new Andy Serkis) dedicated orc chieftain Durotan, Ben Foster's wizard extraordinaire Medivh and Paula Patton's misjudged orc outcast Garona, but none of these characters or performers feel like figures that can bring the films rather lacklustre story of portal traveling orcs trying to take over peaceful lands to life.

The films script is sadly one of the years worst, as dialogue is delivered in wooden fashion and feels like an odd mix of fan service and trying to appeal to a mass audience less inclined to dress up for a LARP party, and for many average movie goer, Warcraft's intense lore and talk about all manner of fantastical possibilities will be far from engaging.

The biggest shame of all about this potentially exciting and fun adventure is that very fact: it has potential.

There's moments spread throughout this journey from stunning CGI scenery and battles that could've easily matched LOTR for sword-lead spectacle (even if some of the films computer generated effects seem rather suspect for such a big budgeted event) that suggest a film that really could've been something special for both the die-hard fans and those that just like good old fashioned movie escapism, and Jones as we've come to expect from him over his short career shows directional tics that reassure us his long gestating Moon follow up (of sorts) Mute is still a film to get rather excited for.

There have been a huge collection of worse films than Warcraft released this year, a number of which share just a big of a budget and name brand recognition, but with the weight of expectation comes standards many expect and unfortunately for this wannabe franchise starter (which will unlikely spawn films of similar budget and release hype), Warcraft is neither the film fans waited years for or the film movie fans quietly hoped would finally break the video game to movie curse in a big way.

2 Shrek like orc babies out of 5",4
Warcraft,"The movie is two hours long but it doesn't tell any story. Unfortunately, the feeling doesn't go away. The only good thing is the final battle. It is impossible to understand how they shot a two-hour movie without telling anything. I think it got a six-point vote from IMDB. It's definitely not bad, the visual effects and battle scenes are better than the story. I think this movie should have been released as two separate movies instead of one. Also how are elfs scarier than orgs in the movie? I don't know much about the game universe and I don't know what the players or the readers think about the movie, but I think the movie is a four out of ten.",4
Zootopia,"This is one of the most cringe movies to come out of Disney's studios. This looks more like something you would get from Dreamworks. I wouldn't let my kids watch this even if I had any. The slow sloth at the bank made me want to take it the DVD player and break it into multiple chips. About 15 minutes after watching a movie. I'll begin having one of the worst headaches to if the magic school bus just accidentally imbeggined inside my small intestine. I didn't want to go to bed but I didn't want to talk to anyone for about a week. This will be the last time I ever watch this movie ever. If I come over to your house and it's on the tv. I'm firing up my exhaust pipes driving to go to waffle house, and I will be waiting there until the movie is over.",1
Zootopia,"I was told this was good. I regret listening to that person. This movie is as hollow as it's sound effects, it's more lifeless than a puppet show, in fact, it looks worse than a puppet show at times. Meaningless corporate complacency, you would have a better time looking into the abyss because at least the abyss is staring back.",1
Zootopia,"Disney's SJWs come through again to preach their message. Sorry - not here for that - just want a good story that entertains.

Movie gets a 1 only for the sloths in the DMV - THAT seems true to life.",1
Zootopia,"While watching this movie I really liked the quality of the animation. But then that pos song came on. I blocked it out best I could, then the movie went on. I could never forgive the greedy marketers for this song, so by default I took off 5 stars. I was content with giving it 5 stars. 10 for nice story and animation 1 star for the bad song. A compromise if you will. BUT THEN THEY PLAYED THIS POS SONG AGAIN AT THE END OF THE MOVIE!!! One star it is!

I cannot forgive it. We get it you wanna create as many revenue streams as possible. Selling the movie, soundtrack, toys, happy meals, clothing, posters, etc..... BUT you have to stop yourself before you sell out and no one takes you seriously anymore.

Really that song is terrible. Even by pop music standards. I know this movie is supposed to be for kids, but damn TOO REPETITIVE! I feel sorry for anyone that was dragged to this movie.

Why did I watch it you ask? Well I was in the mood for a movie and saw an ad for this. And thought, well maybe it's not just another dumb kids movie, boy was I wrong.

Another problem this movie has is that it's too current. Too many references to modern day things. I miss classic Disney movies, you know the hand drawn 2D ones. I really hate how greedy Disney has become. They spit out a bs animated movie that you will forget 5 seconds later cuz the next bs animated movie is coming out!!!! Whereas Cinderella, Aladdin, The Lion King, etc.... are enduring. They even talked about pirated movies in this....as if to explain why they have to crank out so many movies.

Most people will buy into this, they are blinded by the Disney brand. Not everything Disney makes is gold. I, as much as my happiness is chagrined, have standards. And I just can't enjoy such an empty movie. It basically boils down to small town girl fights big town corruption. And we tackle sexism, racism, cellphone humor, slapstick, and other random current things. This is messy. Also for a movie that is against stereotypes they have many in there! But this is not just Disney, most Hollywood movies are like this. They go on at LENGTH about equality but the leads are always young models......",1
Zootopia,"I was not particularly hyped up for the movie, but my family members were. So, as soon as it appeared in the cinema, we went to check it out. It was a huge disappointment to me.

The sounds, visuals, the animation, the 'acting, are all 10 out of 10.

Combine that with an utterly boring, useless, rubbish script.

It's not that the movie got plot holes or anything, but it's got no meaning. The whole Zootopia city and universe held so much possibilities that the creators could have built upon... but instead, they went for a really dumb cliché story.

So as a movie, it's an utter failure. As a CGI render, it's a nice video.

About the story, I am still confused. There are two things at the end. First, you can be anything and can do anything - which is kinda not true - but hey, kids do love false dreams. And the second is, it's perfectly fine to be oppressed, to be ruled by the predators. Which was the weirdest part. I mean, yeah, evil sheep, boo. But she was kinda right.

I won't waste any more words, I just hope Disney will step it up next time.",1
Zootopia,"This movie has been EXTREMELY over-hyped and is definitely not for children. It is mean-most of the characters are -in the end mean and totally antagonistic. It features evil programming...""do not try to dream or go beyond your comfort zone""...yeah, thanks for that Mom and Dad.... Sure , the animation is great , but , as substance goes this ranks at the bottom of the pit. I AM a fan of GOOD animated movies (""The Incredibles"" anyone?), but this one is just a HUGE disappointment.

I regret paying to see this movie, and I have never rated a movie a ""1"", but this one deserves it...

THE ONLY ""redeeming"" point is that it features Tommy Chong for 4 minutes or so.....",1
Zootopia,"I decided to watch this Disney's movie for it seems to have an original scenario with a mesmerizing visual. It is a beautiful movie to watch and quite entertaining for the first 30 minutes. But then it ceased to be watchable with all the old clichés recycled by Disney, not to mention the horrible soundtrack.

It is no doubt an allegory of the modern world, the all too American city with an all too American dream, struggling to deal with its own diversity. Only, in this scenario, the diversity is oversimplified for the benefit of young minds: there are predators and there are preys. Predators traditionally eat preys, we get that. Somehow the civilized world infused with an American dream ""Yes, we can."" has tamed all the individuals within the predatory species. There's still crime, though, that's why Bunny needs to become a police officer.

An ode to tolerance and respect of diversity gone terribly wrong: we learn that being bad has nothing to do with your DNA, nor the fact of being good has anything to do with your upbringing or experience. Then we have to agree that to make the world a better place we need to accept that status quo while trying as hard as one could to succeed within that frame. Fighting for the weak 99%, we have to accept that the 1% is not inherently bad.

Oh wait, who is this 1% ? They're the powerful (lion mayor), but also the prejudiced (foxes). They're the privileged, but also the criminals. On the other hand, preys are all underprivileged and struggling to gain some power; they are nevertheless the ones to whom the message is directed: prejudices come from them too and THAT could make everyone worse off.

Predators do not have to work for a better world, all they have to do is to accept that preys could do things, too, only preys have to succeed far better than any predator ever could given the same circumstances or the same DNA...

It makes me want to reply to that: We need to acknowledge the elephant in the room.",1
Zootopia,"I was very excited to see Zootopia because I had hear great things about it. Sadly, this movie was a huge disappointment. The theme of accepting people regardless of any preconceived biases is a good lesson, but it could have been done so much better with much more impactful characters. Plus I really don't understand why any of the writers didn't catch that they are basically promoting the idea that when a cop does something, it is okay and justified but if a regular person does it, it is wrong and they should be punished. They joke that the well-known con character in the film (the fox) should be a cop because he is so sly and good at getting information from people. The rabbit even uses the same exact tactics that the fox does, but this is never addressed as being wrong. She breaks into an area where she would like to search (but does not have a warrant), she then says its okay because she has ""probable cause."" I was waiting for the movie to get to the part where she realizes she is using her badge to break the law and that makes her no better than the ""criminals"" she deals with. Not to mention, for a film preaching acceptance and not judging people by their appearance, they have some pretty black and white characters (especially their criminals). I don't recommend this to anyone and I don't understand why this movie was even made. Not fun for me, definitely don't see how a kid would enjoy this poorly constructed waste of time.",1
Zootopia,"Zootopia. A popular and buzz worthy film. But why? It has nothing new going for it AT ALL. It's been done to death. It's crammed full of nowadays and pop culture references and silly humor. It does nothing fresh or different.

The characters are clichéd and nothing new either. Again, WDAS gives us another quirky, optimistic, spunky female lead. Judy is the same as every other WDAS character ever made, except for a small few like Elsa, Meg, Mulan, and that gal from Atlantis.

It's so-so, but not superior in any way, because it doesn't actually do anything new or ground-breaking. It's the same old by-the-book cop story, same old cliché plot, and a moral that is handled blatantly and obviously and just keeps beating you over the head with it every minute... It's visually nice, but it lacks any subtlety.

And the sexualizing of animals is sick and people who go crazy over wanting to do Hopps sexually and such need lives. Seriously. Messed up.

Overall, this film is all hyped now but will most likely end up forgotten years from now unlike actual good Disney films (even some of the more recent ones).

This movie is right up there with Chicken Little and Home on the Range. Shame. After Tangled, WDAS has had some good stuff like Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen and hell, even BH6 was better than this furry lovers film (seriously...wth...)

This movie is for those who like it safe and not wanting to spend time watching a film that is creative, new, original, and unique.

Disney is better than this type of film. Hope they can be impressive again soon. Sadly, all we have now is this terrible film.",1
Zootopia,"Zootopia is Disney's latest propaganda piece for the fascist police state. They don't even bother to be subtle any more; nothing is left to the imagination. It's all here - the 99 percent vs the one percent, cops who just want to serve and protect you (and BTW they're definitely NOT serving the one percent), and ubiquitous public cameras that help solve crimes. And the punch line? The one percent are really your friends - it's those ingrate 99-percenters who are the real criminals.

This film is wonderful way to encourage impressionable young children to conform into little statist robots who will gladly empty their minds and hearts to serve as a cog in the machine of the modern lie.

And now, a message from your master...",1
Zootopia,"First thing's first: Yes I know a lot of Furries were excited for this film, claiming they FINALLY got a film dedicated to furries! Except, their are PLENTY of other furry films out there, like Rock N Rule, Fritz The Cat, and Meet The Feebles to name a few. But I guess cause it's Disney it gets a free-pass? Anyway, onto the review: This is one,if not THE, worst films of 2016 and probably one of Disney's worst. It's main issue is that we seen this type of story done before and done better in countless of other movies (But as always, whenever Disney does it, they get a free pass). It's basic premise is that Judy Hops is the first rabbit to join the Police force but must join forces with a well-known con named Nick, a fox (haha I get it cause Foxes are known to be sneaky...wasn't that used before?) to uncover a sinister plot involving certain citizens of Zootopia reverting back to their predatory status and *SPOILERS* they find out that it was all the work of Deputy Mayor Bellwether. To put it in simpler terms: This is a movie about both Racism and SJWs. The characters are boring to the point of being predictable. Heck, most of the characters advertised are only there for only a joke or as a background character. As for the villain behind the plot, they're a SJW character and they want the world to fear predators like they used to...ANOTHER element we seen before. As for the animation, it's Disney, you'd expect great animation from them and here it's once again great. But that is the only positive I'll give it. The little attention to details are amazing at times and the way each animal is animated is clever and unique, Now, one scene in particular made me go and ask ""WHY did Disney put this in the film?!"" and it's one of the heavily advertised scenes. Said scene being the music scene with Shakira's character. Why do I have a problem with this scene? Well, the way the tiger characters are dressed and the way they are dancing, it is pretty much male strippers dancing. Disney...this is a film for FAMILIES so WHY did you put male strippers in the film?! You know, I wanted to like this film cause I thought Disney was doing something unique and different, but I can not bring myself to neither liking this film nor recommending it to anyone. If you want a furry film done right AND is creative and unique, watch either Fritz The Cat, Rock N Rule, or Meet The Feebles, If you want a MUST- SEE film in theaters, go and see Deadpool for a 20th time or save your cash for Ice Age: Collision Course, Warcraft, or any of the other films coming out this year. Even if you take the furry element out of this movie, this is still one of the worst films I've seen. Sorry, Disney, but this is the worst film of 2016 and one of your worst films in a while.

And just a quick edit: Really Disney?! A Breaking Bad reference? IN A FAMILY FILM!? WHAT CHILD WATCHES BREAKING BAD?!",1
Zootopia,"A great example of how didactism bores rather than inspires, regurgitates rather than re-imagines. There's a clear political message, and the unabashed way which it is presented won't change any minds, but at the least may spark political debate. Though its singular treatment preaching the current ""hip"" left-wing social platforms without nuance does nothing to elucidate any new ideas or attempt to shed new truths on issues that allow people to re-evaluate their current ideological stances. As such, its effect is similar to that of the person talking politics at the cocktail party who relies on volume rather than substance in order to bolster their (or more accurately their party's) talking points.

All in all, though there are some witty scenes and stereotypical romance & coming of age story lines, the overpowering pedantic verbal diarrhea exposes it as a thinly veiled political commercial rather than a great piece of art. The ratings, therefore, represent the extent to which the audience agrees with its sermon rather than recognizes its degree of unbiased (with respect to 21st century American politics) aesthetic merit.",1
Zootopia,"Disney does not make movies for children anymore. They make movies for adults now with some of the most repulsive undertones in them (such as into the woods, for example). This movie is embarrassing and unnecessarily crude. Disney is starting to make animated films that are not appropriate for children. The whole ""nudist"" thing was disgusting. For your information Disney I have the right to judge whoever I want, and that includes people who think it is okay to run around naked. I will not be taking my children to this insulting adult film. It's amazing how far Disney has fallen. The cartoon Robin Hood from 1973 was a story about furies and it was perfectly decent, but this film is just awful. Sure the animation is great, some of the characters are cute and humorous, but as far as the story goes it is rehashed from several things, including the Godfather. I'm tired of Disney making their animated films for adults and not children. This movie, along with The Good Dinosaur, are just the animation flops this year. I can't understand why Disney has such trouble making good animated films (Inside Out was good but the other Disney animations this year were terrible). Stop trying to be a world politician Disney, by forcing your opinions on everyone else and attempting to brainwash children by placing these opinions in movies that are supposed to be for children. I can only hope that the live-action Jungle Book and Finding Dory and Moana will be better, but I seriously doubt they will.

If you like furies then you might have fun with this film, but seriously I thought the movie was overly crude.",1
Zootopia,"There was not even one funny content, sloppy dialogs, and the story totally flat. I doubt it was a comedy. I wouldn't suggest it for children, as the plot is hardly understandable even adults. By understandable I mean exciting. This movie just happened. No memories left. No magic left. It's hard to write anything cause the movie was empty. Disappointing. I love Lion the King, Tangled, WALL-E, Hercules, but this movie is a disgrace! It is full of humor for adults, crappy humor by the way. Children sitting behind me asked their father: ""Can we go home, please"", and it was just 30 minutes of movie. They started asking repeatedly after one hour. I totally agreed with them. I wanted to go home and watch Lion the King. I wanted my evening back. Nice marketing Disney! Sadly. You won't catch me again. Is it the end of animation for children and people with young hearts?",1
Zootopia,"This movie is often seen as being an excellent action-humor combo containing a great moral component. I will briefly try to explain while it is neither of those things.

First, I'll start by admitting that the humor present in the movie can work if you put yourself in a certain mood. It is combined with a great visual production aiming at putting you in that exact light-hearted mood, which works fine. The problem is largely the plot: it is uninspired (recycled) and things seems to happen as if they came from a magician's hat. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the random/surprising elements where entertaining. The problem is that, while it somehow works in the beginning, where the evolution of the plot make us discover Zootopia, the story becomes quickly bland an uninteresting as the movie enter an action phase.

As for the interesting moral components this movie is credited for, they are inexistent. The whole lesson of the whole thing appears to be that you shouldn't listen to your prejudices, and you should be accepting of everybody. We could also add the classical: you can be anything you want if only you would try hard enough. I would start by saying that these ""lessons"" are so obvious and in-your-face that they cannot have any effect on children. They are what the movie SAYS, but in fact the movie DOES something very different. What it does is to make a link between a character's specie and his personality (in direct contradiction with the lesson about prejudice and promoting inclusion). It also treat most supporting character as pure stereotypes based on specie, which reduce their humanity in the eye of the viewer while using it as joke material. So what the movie in fact does is to tell you that large chunk of population have very few value, while those who deserve respect are the ones who ""work hard"" to obtain and maintain power over others, be it by wise manipulation or socially recognized opportunity to exert physical domination of others (police). This also implies that those who the film laugh at are deserving of their situation, as they didn't work hard enough to raise above the masses.

In short, this movie is a montage of jokes with a plot to support those jokes, which tries to compensate for its lack of substance with ""lessons"" that are nothing more than virtue-signaling.",1
Zootopia,"First 40 minutes were fun, light and entertaining, i would describe that kind of experience as ""excellent"", but after next 16 minutes film it was set to zero. After finishing i've felt very much like (mentally) squeezed lemon. Everything that happened after 40 minutes is complete narration's inconsequential disaster for 6 year old kids( and HOW it happened and directed)! I mean, it amazes me every time how in nearly every series or movie it starts with something cool and then end on the bottom, when suddenly everything stops being sane, when writing, dialogues, plot becomes over the top idiotic and unsatisfying in any way! Definitely skip this one. Movie for the kids(or how they often called ""for family view"") not means ""bad movie"". So, what you want is good animated movie? Go check Finding Nemo, Incredibles,Schreck 2, Cars or if you not care so much about top tier animation something like Dobrynya and the Dragon.",2
Zootopia,"Preachy, proselytizing, pandering, predictable piece pretending to be children's fare. Boring at that. But what else would you expect from the denizens of Bubbletopia who constructed this propaganda from their glass studios? Teaching not to stereotype WHILE stereotyping?? I guess some groups aren't vocal enough to be protected. Can't have it both ways, Disney. Furthermore, this cartoon afterschool special has the morality of a criminal defense lawyer: the reason why people are bad is because other people were bad to them first. Right. In the next installment of this fluff, why not have the fat cheetah come all the way out? Force that uncomfortable car ride home on the unwitting parents who want to raise their own kids the way they see fit. P.S. Practice what you preach, Bubbletopia. Welcome the so-called predators in your tightly secured, not-so-diverse enclave and see if they want to sing Kumbaya witcha. And no, the sloths were not funny.",2
Zootopia,"That's not what you want to see when you sit with your 4-year-old daughter. For a kid, this is plain boring and useless after five minutes. Why anyone would want to put a thriller/conspiracy/drama in cartoon? Come on, cartoon should be for kids, not for adults. It's just incredible to see how many positive reviews this received. No one really put this into perspective? Next step? A horror movie with cartoons? If you want to have a go with it, don't do it with a kid: you will be forced to walk out from it after less than half an hour. And if you are a grown up and enjoy it, well, that's something you have to think about... :-) Ah, yes, there are a couple of funny lines in it, that kids obviously won't understand.",2
Zootopia,"Voice acting and animation quality - great.

Plot? meh.

Humor? I think I laughed twice. Sloths and the Tommy Chong wildebeest perhaps.

Some decent action scenes.

Overall impression was ""This needs to be a lot funnier, and a lot less ham-fisted with its cliché social justice message (that actually makes no sense because there are real biological differences between animals)""",2
Zootopia,"This movie is an attempt to make children become democrat, and it isn't subtle. It sends a message that we should hold people blameless for their bad behavior e.g. the sly fox in the movie:), and instead blame stereotypes for that person's bad behavior.

The writers of the movie tried to act as if the move were aware of behavior that supports stereotypes, per the naïve bunny cop (political symbol for women getting in the military/police via gender discrimination programs, as attested by the assistant mayor lamb) who defends the publicly discriminated-against fox (symbol for black people) who ironically ends up behaving exactly in line with the stereotype (swindling the store to make money dishonestly).

So the naïve bunny gets a taste of reality with the fox acting sly even though she wanted to believe that he was good and that everyone else who was discriminating against the fox was evil and wrong and stupid. So at that point, the movie appears to be informed and aware of how groups of people truly behave, and shows how stereotypes exist because of supporting behavior/statistics.

However, later the movie exonerates this fox's behavior by telling a story. Once when the fox was a child, he was discriminated against by non-predator mammals. The child fox then, and only then, decided that he might as well act like the stereotype because that's how people would treat him regardless. And voila, the movie exonerates the fox, holding him blameless for his wayward life. It shifts the guilt on everyone else, except the badly behaved. This movie poisons children's' minds to think that stereotypes are what cause bad behavior. It warps the child's perspective into thinking that people would act perfectly as long as we assume they will. It has the aim to render our children mindless about actual statistics and behavior when in comes to groups of people. For example, if you have a few bad burritos in a row at Chipotle then its okay if you don't like the place and don't want to go back. But this movie tries to dumb down the mind and say that you're not allowed to use that same basic logic when you are treated rudely a few times in a row in your first experiences with black female cashiers at Walmart. This movie mistakenly says that your mind must shut down when it comes behavioral patterns in people / races / ethnicities / demographic groups / financial classes.

Of course, there are no universal stereotypes. There are always exceptions and sometimes they are material exceptions. But people ARE accountable for their own actions and people's behavior/attitudes CAN be generalized because their own behavior supports it in large numbers. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is the real racist. They are the ones that will ignore reality in the name of race. They will ignore behavior in the name of race. Well, that's the definition of racism - making judgments based upon race only, and ignoring behavior.

Besides the sloths, which are hilarious by the way, this movie is worse than nothing. Please protect your children from this movie. Their entire voting future, friend associations, schools of choice, marriage partners, and jobs may depend on it.",2
Zootopia,"The movie is well animated and there were a few lines that made me laugh but overall the movie fails to deliver on it's liberal and multiculturalist message. The problem is that is uses the worst metaphor possible by putting all these different species of animals together. There is a reason they segregate the animals at real zoos, if you mixed them together you would have zoopocalyspe not zootopia. So the metaphor fails in that it is promoting values that are unnatural.

The fox character lives up to his stereotype but then the movie comes up with a very contrived reason for this that isn't very believable. The explanation in why the predators ""revert back to their nature"" is even more absurd rather than just to accept the truth, that they are predators and it's in their nature to behave that way.

The funniest part of the movie is the sloths in the DMV. Here the movie goes off it's message and comes up with a great metaphor for anybody who has had to deal with idiots promoted into jobs via affirmative action.

The movie would have been hilarious if they would have changed a few things and made it a parody.",2
Zootopia,"As an adult watching Zootopia, I really enjoyed it. The plot is original, engaging, with multiple plot twists and entertaining. Its on a par with Spiderman, Batman and those type of action movies. That is why everyone is giving 10 out of 10. But my 6 year old burst into tears - way way too much violence, fright scenes and explosive action scenes for a Disney Movie, even with parental guidance. I think its very sad that children movie makers feel the need to get children's hearts racing, just to keep them entertained. It was very over-stimulating for my 6 year old. The story plot was good enough without the need for all the over the top action scenes. It was the same as an adult action movie but with animals instead of 'stallone'. From a child's perspective, my child gave it a 2 out of 10 because it was 'too scary'.",2
Zootopia,"Stupidity took this movie down while the premise still had some allure as being somewhat of a modern-day ""animal farm""but sadly that wasn't the case here.

It is certainly not a classic because it's build to much in to today's standards and contains the same elements as a lot of today's movies like feminism,racism and sexism.

Other factors that are connected to theses elements are not so much highlighted like religion or social structures within this society. It wants to preach diversity but gives a one-sided view to the story and gives all kinds of awkward messages doing so.

All the focus was on the bunny and the rest of the characters seem to tag a long to make sure everyone is better in the end by meeting her because she is such an inspiration.It reminded me a little of the 'Rey""character in"" the forge awakens""but than to a lesser extent.A ""close to Mary Sue"" character basically.

I wanted more entertainment out this and also a story that served all the people and not the few ""hot topics""that are only important for a couple of years.I think that with the passing of time the movie will loose momentum

and that it is not the timeless piece that people said it was.

The Shakira song was terrible and did not fit the movie at all and the animation was ""acceptable"".I had a few laughs but not nearly as many as i get from watching a 20 minute episode of Southpark.

I was disappointed by it but by looking at the raving reviews realized I pretty much stand alone in this.

It's not bad.....just blatant PC.

Nice bunny,but no bugs!

Fox this!",2
Zootopia,"Sluggish plot that is kind of predictable, a violent detective story that was not exactly for kids, but most of all it was chock-full of multicultural leftist propaganda that will leave you thinking you just watched a govt infomercial.

The entire movie was a thinly-veiled message on tolerating the more 'aggressive' members of our society (who were all more 'ethnic' animals) and learning to trust/adopt rather than deport them.

I think Frozen marked the beginning of the shift toward the left that Disney will be doing for the next films. I don't think I'm going to see any more of them. Children's movies should not be tools for political messaging.",2
Zootopia,"This movie is a waste of resources in all sense. Is again the typical weak that saves the day but animals instead of humans.

In points:

-The storyline sucks, boring, slow, I can't keep my eyes or my child's eyes open. The entire movie is a ""police"" investigation in 80's style, with few and boring jokes

-The only funny scene is in the public administration, I have to admit, but the only? This kind of movie give a lot of resources to play, animals that are funny by themselves.

-Moral..., again? This bores to everyone, if you want moral, you must read Nietzsche, or talk to your kids, don't go to the cinema, because is no made for that.

Sorry for the English, no native.",2
Zootopia,"The problem with this title , and this serves as a warning to parents , is that is nothing like the trailer ! I took both my grandchildren to see it and regret it. Violence, scary Unnecessary scenes of deep darkness and monsters! Only funny part is the sloths at the information counters... They really wasted great pictures and technology on this one. The title song with Shakira is wonderful.. But the balance is very disappointing. I wish i had known of that before. Again ,one of those cases where a trailer is so misleading!

Please talk to people who have seen it to see if they agree.Would like to know if other people share my opinion.",2
Zootopia,"Zootopia is another attempt to propagandize for multiculturalism, coming from the same studio which once produced an uplifting allegory for traditional white identity and aristocracy. In line with the dominant elite view on race, it manages to simultaneously push wild-eyed optimism and a paranoid victim attitude. Considering that it met with very positive critical response, including praise for its political message, the subtitle might as well be This is What Our Elites Actually Believe.

As the title implies, the film depicts an unrealistic society inhabited by various animals. The heroine, Judy Hopps, is an effervescent rabbit from a rural area whose parents hope that she will become a carrot farmer like themselves. Their bluntly stated and cartoonish view is that you should not try new things because you might fail. Rejecting this view, Judy aspires to be a police officer, unmoved by their insistence that no bunny has ever held that title. A fox bully assaults her and tells her again of the mismatch between her species and her career aspirations, but she ignores this as well.

The multicult message continues when Judy gets ready to leave for Zootopia to begin her law enforcement career. Her parents display excessive concern over her possible future encounters with foxes, offering her fox repellent and even a taser to defend herself with. They remind her of her experience with the fox Gideon Grey who assaulted her years ago, but our heroine recites lines to the effect of ""NAXALT"" and ""some of us are jerks too.""

Nick then recounts how he consciously decided that if others saw him as untrustworthy, he might as well act that way. Now an adult, he had bragged earlier in the film that he had been running scams every day since the age of 12. There was no mention of previous antisocial tendencies. The accusation that others' rejection can turn an otherwise respectable person into a professional lowlife is of course paranoid, but familiar to anyone who has heard the terms ""marginalized"" or ""stereotype threat."" The fox serves as an expression of the external locus of control so common among dysfunctional people.

Blaming external racist forces for degeneracy in one's own group should be a familiar concept to American viewers. This plot point is reminiscent of conspiracy theories about the CIA inventing and/or distributing crack cocaine to keep the Black man down, or similar popular theories concerning HIV. The seminal 1944 title An American Dilemma by the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal accused White prejudices of encouraging low standards of morality among Blacks, which in turn reinforced White prejudices, and so on in a vicious cycle.

Of course, today even the implication that there are different standards of morality between races or nationalities would be dismissed as racist. Other than of the victims of the conspiracy, there is no mention in the film of any actual difference in values or behavior between contemporary predators and prey animals.

However, the differences between species in Zootopia are dramatic, not only in size and shape but in some aspects of behavior. The sloths who form the staff of the DMV are as slow as actual sloths, even in their speech. There is no pretense of equality in this context; Nick even sarcastically asks Judy if she thinks that someone must be slow just because he is a sloth. Integration of sloths into rabbit or sheep classrooms would obviously be absurd.

The film's denunciation of racism is partly based on attempts at humor, which is an appropriate choice for propaganda. Judy praises Nick as ""articulate"" and he responds by complimenting her on how ""non-patronizing"" she is, highlighting her ""racism."" Nick touches the sheep assistant mayor's wool without her knowledge, comically amused by how fluffy it is. Judy reprimands him to the effect that ""you can't just touch a sheep's wool."" She makes another reference to the racial sensitivities of American Blacks when she explains that a bunny can call another bunny cute, but when another animal does it, it is offensive.

The portrayal of ""racist"" characters is not as vitriolic as social justice warriors might like, but of course still fits with the overall agenda. While some ""prejudiced"" characters such as the elephant storekeeper and the young Gideon Gray are portrayed as hostile, the racist parents are portrayed as earnest and good-natured yet ignorant. Judy is to some degree portrayed the same way, when she innocently suggests that the basis of the predators going savage might be something in their biology. The results are not harmless though, as she triggers a wave of ""xenophobia"" against predators. Nick makes a great show of being offended by her racist thoughts, even testing her to confirm that she is in fact afraid of him, and she resigns in shame.

Zootopia makes a weak attempt at being less than utopian; Judy's original expectations of a city where everyone gets along are shown to be overly optimistic, which she ultimately admits in a voice-over at the end of the film. The attempts at justifying continued faith in multiculturalism come off as desperate, though. Judy recites slogans such as ""real life's a bit more complicated than a slogan,"" adding that the ""glass is half full"" and ""we all have a lot in common,"" but she does not sound as though she actually believes it. Of course, no one ever presents any particular reason to believe it; those who do not are simply not presented as reliable sources.

The film ends with a scantily clad gazelle performing a degenerate pop song by the Colombian singer Shakira which further highlights the underlying mindset. The lyrics of ""Try Everything"" celebrate mindless optimism and seem to be intended as a cheap form of therapy for someone who has a crippling fear of failure, reassuring them that ""nobody learns without getting it wrong"" and ""sometimes we come last but we did our best.""",2
Zootopia,"Well, as always, critics and people will love this movie, cause it's Disney!(which I deeply love). In reality it's because there haven't been great animated movies in a decade and people are not even noticing how much the standard level is more and more lowering(except Tangled and Toy Story 3, the others were good ideas, with cheap, bland and boring results).

GRAPHICS: Once again, we have an animated movie that try to reach even more graphical perfection: the world is wonderfully detailed but its pretty clear that every character of every movie created in CG will look the same. The way they move, the eyes, the facial expressions, are so graphically realistic and at the same time done with exaggerated animated acting, that it's always like watching bad mimes who are playing a part. Rating: 9\10 for the world, 3\10 for the characters(and that's almost the maximum for CGI).

CHARACTERS: The fact that Disney can't create great characters anymore is depressing. The characters are boring once again; they are just created to give the most banal and predictable comedy one can watch on a TV sit-com. That's exactly the kind of humor in animation and comedy movies by now. Or even more easy: ""Look! an hamster who moves like an hamster! funny!"". The fact that an animal has its animal characteristics is the minimum I expect from Disney animation, and even more in the aesthetic normality of the world Zootopia, not treated as a joke. Or even worse, all the pop-culture references, cause they are funny! Ratings: 4\10

STORY: The story is kind of good, with a dark tone, and somewhat interesting, but again, the characters are so bland in their predictable personality that I didn't managed to care very much. The point is that, in great artists hand, this could have been a nice movie. Ratings: 6\10

And then we got the today moral lesson. That's not a fault for this movie to be honest, because it seems every animated movie must have a moral. And I still don't understand why . Animated movies are an aesthetic art, just like another movie, and not an educational lesson. It's because adults are so dumb nowadays(I'm sorry, but we all know that) that think if something is not educational is not for children. I have an information for you: children are smarter than adults, and they need to be treated as such.

Disney, please, don't waste too much time coming up with lessons and a movie created around it, give us some GREAT CHARACTERS AND STORIES like you used to do, and the great lessons of life would come along.

FINAL RATINGS: My vote is 5 on a total scale(of all time), and a 7 in the last ten years scale; but the whole feeling of the movie (the characters, the humor, the dynamics) is always the same of every recent animated movie, so I lower it to 2(since I know everybody will give it 10\10).",2
Zootopia,"Prey is evil, predators are innocent and entirely blameless. Sure. What could go wrong? Don't have to worry about schools teaching Critical Race Theory, Disney is doing it for them.",3
Zootopia,"While I'm sure this is fine fare in the world of kindergartners, it needs to be rated ""not suitable for all ages"".

As for why IMDb insists on wasting my time requiring I fill out 5 lines of dialog is mystery. Imagine if Twitters business model required the same! I'm just trying to put up a caution notice so others won't expect what this movie can't deliver.",3
Zootopia,"I think this is another propaganda of liberalism and politics, in this movie they bring out matter that weak honest people can be so cruel that they can oppress bad people, like they want us to believe in real life (but it's not so). it is the shame that this movie is in 250 top list.",3
Zootopia,"One thing has to be said about this Disney piece: it is propaganda. Yes, you read right. This is the right name for when a false idea is presented as 100% truth. In this case, nobody even tries to hide it. It has 'utopia' in its very name.

That said, I have to admit that it is pretty well delivered. Great animation (*), decent story(*), nice dialogue(*) and probably a crazy budget. Everything you need. Hence my 3 stars. If only I wasn't so annoyed after watching it with my kid!

Now, obviously this was made with children in mind, and so the tendency to present the world in pink light is not a bad idea. ""Zootopia"", however, takes it to the extreme and beyond. It sells a lie. It is, in fact, a metaphor of a liberal, multi-culture mix of society, where everybody should turn the other cheek, be politically correct and accept/tolerate just about everything. Just because tolerance is such a nice word. And because the predators can be tamed. And learn to eat carrots.

Well, reality check. They can't. Both in reality and in metaphor.

So, unless you wish to start brainwashing your children's really early, I suggest you wait and let them choose their political affiliation a little later.",3
Zootopia,"Animations can be wonderful even when pitched to children. Toy Story 2 is a great movie plain and simple. I don't mean for an animation it's great, it's great as a story. The open act of Up is as moving as any act in any live actor movie as well. Just because these two examples (of many possible) are cartoon figures, doesn't mean they can't have depth and move us.

Not so here. We have the same perky female lead we are now having our faces rubbed in time after time. She's weak but takes on all because, by gosh, there are no limitations to what you can do other than in your own head. It's not that I'm opposed to this message, but rather Disney has pushed this out so often that we either get it or don't so let's move on. Isn't there another message possible?

Or gee, let's get radical and have a movie that entertains rather than preaches. What a concept!!!

So because it's a plucky female lead, we have no tension. We know that she'll come out ahead and better for the experience and the world will be better because she persisted in her remorseless pluck.

Underlying all this for, I suppose, the pervs in the audience, there is some sort of odd sexuality and rather uncomfortable suggestions going on. It's a sour note that doesn't offset the saccharine dominant note but rather only adds a nasty undertone to the production.

So the same movie with different characters showing that effort aside from CGI doesn't exist or at least it's died entirely in Hollywood.",3
Zootopia,"This movie scared the living daylights out of my 3 and 4 year old. The content was not really funny (It had a couple of spots but they were few and far between). The worst part of the movie was a Silence of the Lambs Insanity Ward where the beasts were kept. (Remember Jody Foster getting semen thrown at her) My children cried and we left the theater when the (spoiler alert, near the end) . The movie should be rated PG13 as the themes were more suited to teenagers who could handle aggressive animals, mob mentality of killing someone, New York style hardcore sarcasm where no one cares about anyone, and Meth lab where an insane looking sheep in an DU HAST video with air breather is making ""night howler"" I am a guy that has seen his fair share of freaky, and I love a good movie (going for Apocalypse Now tonight) BUT this show is not for kids, and I am aghast that Disney put it out. I remember enjoying the time of Toy Story, Nemo, Hero 6, Wall-e, Up and great Disney Movies (Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar from the ""other guys"") This movie was to deep in subject matter and the message was for teenagers and not little children.",3
Zootopia,"Most people do like this movie, that's good for them. I obviously didn't! I honestly don't get it why people say this is for both kids and adults.

This is most obviously a kids movie! The story is tedious and predictable, the humor is nearly non-existent, the characers are either dull or even unlikable, and also I can't stand Shakira's song when it plays. I even had to mute the movie while watching it.

The only good things I can give credit for is that the animation is well done with some creativity displayed, some of the jokes were funny, and it does handle its message about accepting each other decently.

Even so, I don't recommend watching this movie!!!",4
Zootopia,"Ahoi cheesyness! This is as sugar sweet as it gets. So Disney! But if you're a fan, you will love this!",4
Zootopia,"I don't get how people thought that this was so good, like I heard people saying ""This was better than Wreck it Ralph"" or ""Wow, this is the best movie since Emperor's New Clothes or even 1990!"". After coming back from the theater, I didn't feel the same way as other people did. I thought that it had a nice story to it but the characters needed work.

This was not better than Wreck it Ralph, though I gave both similar ratings but I thought the characters of Wreck it Ralph had more effort put into them. After seeing it the second time, I liked it more and it became my all-time favorite, although I was only 14 at the time, I thought that it was a nice break from seeing something overly intense or complex.

Judy Hopps is a young bunny who was bullied as a child. Though, she still was determined and strong, she carried on with her wish on being a cop. Then, she meets a fox who had the same experience she had.

Another small problem was the run time, kids may get bored off of a 108 minute run time. It's a comedy so being at 108 minutes long is too long. But it's still a nice break from something violent or really sad.",4
Zootopia,"Usually I can enjoy a movie while just ignoring all the political and social commentary, but I guess I've been reading too many news articles lately. I just ""got"" too much of this movie's preaching and it ruined it for me.

I hated Wall-E for the same reason. Movies are how I get away from real life. Last thing I need is a dumb cartoon bringing up all the pains and issues of modern society.

Anyway, if you like movies that incorporate social commentary, this one does it as well as you could expect. Also, if you've had the wisdom to ignore the current ""discussions,"" you'll probably find the the hidden meanings subtle enough not to be annoying.

Unfortunately, if you're like me, and keeping up with all the news and related issues are just making you feel ill, you'll probably find this movie leaves somewhat of a bad taste.

In any case, watching this has suddenly made me realized that I need a break from editorials and news articles.

I'm going to make it a point to stop for a while. :\",4
Zootopia,"Equality.

It's the buzzword of 2016.

Anti racist, anti gay, Milo, Milo, go away.

This plot=everyone is racist.

The weak are the powerful.

Everyone who doesn't subscribe to the socialist, liberal agenda is a bigot.

Not a good movie. It's feminist propaganda.

Disney messed up Star Wars, now they are messing with animals.

Reminds me of the Telus commercials. Cute bunnies, ignore that we are stealing your money and telling you lies.

Don't bother. It's not a good movie.",4
Zootopia,"There is no nice way to say a truth about this film.

It is a PC on steroids story of a cultural Marxist PC-topia.

I give it a solid 4 for the effort to camouflage it all into a cartoon. Sly Disney, dumb viewers.

Otherwise, Zootopia is an animated buddy-cop comedy mystery film directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, screenplay by Jared Bush, Phil Jonston and on the main voice-role stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Tommy Chong, J. K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira. Zootopia is a place where all animals, prey and predator live in peace and harmony.",4
Zootopia,"After just seeing the movie with my friends, I am struggling to give more than a 4 out of 10... This is by far one of the worst 3D animations I have seen in the last 5 years, or ever, and we could barely wait until it finishes so that we get out of the theater. The movie is very stressful to watch, and extremely 'humanized'. There is nothing 'animal' about it really. All characters are acting exactly as humans, and not in a good way at all - nasty, obese, following the social programing and expectations to conform others. I would personally not recommend this movie to any child, unless you really want them to become another robot.

To summarize: Boring, dull, not funny, not cute at all.",4
Zootopia,"A cute female rabbit becomes a police officer and is instantly the best officer the world has ever seen - surpassing all of her dumb male co- workers who belittle her for being just a cute dumb bunny. The film then descends into a commentary on racial issues as the rabbit says that a bunch of predators may be attacking people as ""its in their DNA"" and the media and politicians whip up mass hysteria to control the people (ok, that part is pretty valid). The rabbit then learns her lesson about how it's wrong to call out dangerous criminals if they're all from the same race, and that it was really the government manipulating the predators into being evil.

The sloths were pretty funny, though.",4
Zootopia,"""I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.""

J.R.R. Tolkien would have cordially disliked this movie, to put it mildly. This is an extremely preachy movie, which attempts to distill the racial issues of the USA down into black and white. Two takeaways from this movie:

It is perfectly okay for black people to refer to one another as the n-word (IMDB says that is a prohibited word), just as long as non-black people do not:

Clawhauser: ""O. M. Goodness, they really did hire a bunny. Ho-whop! I gotta tell you, you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.""

Judy Hopps: ""Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny 'cute', but when other animals do it, that's a little...""

What a terrible analogy, as ""cute"" is not a disgusting, reviled word. No one should be calling anyone the n-word, but that's not the point the movie makes. It is telling us that as long as you are the same race as someone else, you can treat that person as horribly as you like. Just as long as people of differing races are nice to one another the world will become a utopia.

The second takeaway of the movie is that non-blacks are responsible for all the ills and suffering of black people. Somehow someone white is seeding all the discontent and suffering that black people experience. They are manipulating black people into being ""savages"" (to use the exact term from the movie).

The problem with this totally binary view of the issues of racism and inequality in the USA is that it is inaccurate. It absolves the minority of any responsibility whatsoever. It says that they can maintain the status quo, continue calling one another the n-word, continue murdering one another (93% of murdered black people are killed by another black person), and all of that is perfectly fine. What the movie teaches is that under no circumstances may a non-black use the n-word, rub a black person's hair, or manipulate black people into killing non-black people.

While Disney is to be commended for at least attempting to address the subject (and this alone is the cause célèbre prompting many reviewers to trip over themselves to gush about this film), they should at least address it in an evenhanded, responsible fashion.",4
Zootopia,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I just don't like this movie. The first time I watched it, it just annoyed me but I thought I'd give it a second chance, try and see what people love here. Still don't see it.

On the upside, the animation is pretty. The voice acting is solid. There are even one or two moments of laughter.

That's it though. The rest of this movie still falls apart to me. It feels too predictable and by the numbers. There's a message about equality which is nice but there's no subtlety to it, instead it gets hammered over your head again and again and again. There's no surprise here and I never feel invested in the characters or world. It's fun but not real deep.

Maybe the most annoying thing to me is that I want to like this world and these characters and I just don't. It feels too much like Disney trying to jump on the equality bandwagon which, to me, ends up feeling empty, hollow and fake.

Again, I know I'm the minority here and would still absolutely encourage people to check it out and form their own opinions.",4
Zootopia,"Bright, bubbly, breakneck: all defining characteristics of Disney's latest animated adventure. Sanctimonious, serious, seldom funny: other key traits that suffocate this family film until there's very little left to enjoy. With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural subsets – mirroring our own society wouldn't you know – the anthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and beautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is disappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together plot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy action and constant laughs, yet the film's themes – breaking down stereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive – are hammered home so heavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue is the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which, save for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears, is woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving a point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing too; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is aimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and 'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The infectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the mischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), has more depth and charisma. A lower-rung Disney effort with a gratingly obvious agenda, Zootopia hints at brilliance but frustratingly falls way short.",4
